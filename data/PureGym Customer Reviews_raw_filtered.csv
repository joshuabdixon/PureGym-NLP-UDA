4,2023-12-17,"A well equipped gym, lacked cleaning facilities",a well equipped gym and only noticed one machine out of order. disappointed with the lack of blue towel and sanitizer spray for customers to use once they have finished with equipment. and notices asking customers to do so as a matter of respect for other users
4,2023-12-13,Overall a good experience,"overall a good experience. its still too cramped compared with the old redditch gym, but numbers seem to be reducing a little so equipment is a little more readily available. the changing rooms are far too small though (take a look at sunderland pure gym for comparison). one jewel in the crown is mark fisher. this guys classes are ""insane"" (in the nicest possible way!). book his classes early to avoid disappointment."
5,2023-12-12,Excellent gym,"excellent gym, friendly environment, plenty of choice of equipment and space to do your exercise. personal trainers at hand. excellent opening hours, basically you can go whenever you want 🙌 can get busy at times, but you can always get on something. classes are also very good"
5,2023-11-12,I'm going to be so fit,"havnt been a gym member for 20 years but this is state of the art, brand new with friendly staff and at really good competitive monthly price"
5,2023-12-13,Chloe Lawrence PT at PureGym,"i have been training with chloe lawrence at pure gym for 4 months now, soon to finish my 5th month. she is incredible. she pushes you to your absolute maximum without being aggressive or intimidating. she is so inspiring, and i feel amazing coaching with her and i have noticed such a difference in my strength, mood, sleep and health. coaching with her has also helped me create a good schedule with exercising, she has made me confident enough to go in and do things on my own that i never would have done before. chloe is so informative with nutrition and the biology behind exercise as well so i really feel like i have learned so much in this time. in general chloe is a lovely person and makes such an effort to keep you a priority and you really do feel like you have someone in your corner and on your team during this journey. can’t recommend her highly enough!"
5,2023-12-12,Every time is a beautiful challenge…,"every time is a beautiful challenge working with dominic.i do love his classes ,the music,the vibe... everything. thank you dominic,even if sometimes i feel tired,you build me up with your positivity, and everything seems easier throughout your workout even if is very challenging sometimes 🤣🤣. again thank youuuuu."
5,2023-12-15,A couple of minor points,"i like the gym and the equipment but please can you get the clock to work in the class, it’s a quick fix by changing the battery! also i wish there were pegs at the back of the toilet doors to hang things ."
4,2023-12-10,Great gym and well maintained equipment,"great gym, the kit is excellent and well maintained and theres a nice friendly atmosphere.  however, i wish theyd enforce their rule of not leaving padlocks on lockers, there has been a green padlock on a locker near the entrance for at least a month. also, theres been several mentions on trustpilot of a feedback box but it is nowhere to be seen."
5,2023-12-11,Good equipment,good equipment. friendly atmosphere.  the only thing i find annoying is the amount of people using cameras and tripods.  they are situated in a position where they’re filming other members of the gym which isn’t acceptable.  if you’re filming for personal use or your social media you should be asking permission from other members.
5,2023-12-11,Puregym longbridge is a great place to…,"puregym longbridge is a great place to have a great work out and the staff are all amazing .. the pt… sam, charlotte , jack and whoever i have missed all beautiful staff u can have a laugh and they are so helpful and u just feel safe around  and the managers sam and dave amazing managers so helpful and understanding and gym is spotless .. and sam thankyou for being so so kind to let the guy from the outside use the toilet .. as he told me he was poorly getting over cancer .. you were so helpful and kind to him amazing customer service and i have noticed that u and dave always helpful and always cleaning .. thank you my amazing gym family love it 😊"
2,2023-12-13,Showers are cold,historically the upkeep of the machines/facilities has been slow but ok. in the last 2-3 months the mens showers have been lukewarm at best. i know other members have noticed this.  paying a membership every month for a cold shower is not good enough.  let me worry about my carbon footprint. if the cost has gone up increases the membership fee.
3,2023-12-13,I love Puregym,"i love puregym, and if things were different, id give a 5, but the lack of any staff to help really does drag down the standard. i had a payment issue last month, which the app had no help available so in turn, i had to cancel my account and get a new account. its stupid, and doesnt need to be that rigid. all of last month, i couldnt use yanga water, and just had a rubbish time overall. all over an app not letting me change things in my account. peoples lives have obstacles yet puregym doesnt move like many other companies that adapt. apart from that, love the gym i go to. i can use many other gyms across the country which is great too."
3,2023-12-02,Not worth the end of deal price,"the close proximity to my home is my biggest like about this gym. besides that, the gym, for the price they are charging is not worth it. it’s small. is lacking in the equipment department. after only a few weeks of opening, it has now been closed until further notice due to maintenance. this is appalling. not everyone wants to travel to other locations and have chosen this location for the convenience that is now being taken from them. communication with staff is poor, handling customers possession without permission. the space is not utilised effectively, making the gym smaller than it needs to be. for such a price, a lot more equipment is needed to make my workouts work while and the money. staff look like they do not have a clue. and if i want to invite a buddy the system for me to do so if terrible as i have to delete the first buddy, wait for hours before i can then invite someone else"
3,2023-12-15,Classes cancelled,"this review is about classes only as it to attend them that i joined the gym. the classes are often cancelled last minute, if at all. it happened regularly that i just showed up and the class was cancelled even though it was booked. the quality of the classes, when they happen, is good, but this management issue made me leave this gym and the group after only a few months. regarding the reply, this should be investigated internally and not me to chase. i emailed when i first had the issue and was told i had to go and see the manager at the gym. no contact given and i have never found him."
5,2023-12-04,Great gym. Bring back Leah,"the personal trainers at puregym stretford are all friendly and welcoming. the most talented pt unfortunately has left now. you need to bring back leah, shes awesome and i think lots of people miss her. she has the best spin and step class. great gym for women and great classes run by experienced pts."
5,2023-12-05,Cycle to Fitness,the spin classes are simply fantastic.  marshall/omar/inno/jose/alessio are the reason why i remain consistent and committed.  they always make you feel like you have achieved more than you couldve imagined.  i highly recommend puregym bermondsey.  the management is very helpful and kind and even in the midst of all complaints they go above and beyond to provide everyone a memorable experience.  i couldnt do this fitness journey without the amazing team in bermondsey. absolutely fantastic.
1,2023-12-16,Puregym scam artists,"joined my local puregym when the zero joining fee was on except my local gym was exempt from it and i was charged £15 joining fee. was ready to train over the festive period but i cant do that as my local puregym is closed through out the festive period due to staff shortage... a company thay adverises itself as 24/7 365 days access yet i can not access it when i want because its closed. makes no sence having a policy in place if managers just abuse it. futher more my conversion with the manager team should have stayed between us, our conversion transcript shouldnt have been shared with the staff."
1,2023-12-17,Absolute lack of respect with its customers!!!!!,almost a week with the gym shut and we still haven’t received a single email with an update on how to proceed. i can’t go to any other gyms like (finsbury park) being the nearest one - hence why i joined my local in seven sisters and not the other ones. i have to keep coming to check if the gym is re-opened every day because they have absolutely no commitment in keeping us in the loop. there’s no maintenance being carried out to try to solve the problem. it’s making me think that all this was a catch the £16.99 for the first 6 months offer - and they want us to cancel our membership which has now gone up to £24.99 a month.
5,2023-12-14,Pure gym review,i was greeted with a smile from the staff and some customers who are regularly in attendance. the equipment is very well maintained and very clean.

3,2023-12-17,Basic equipment and layout good showers…,basic equipment and layout good showers and easy access . if you want an easy gym with simple machines and weights then this place is for you and its cheap.
2,2023-12-17,Dirty,dirty. almost never any cleaning equipment. staff don’t enforce use of towels. benches full of sweat and hair gel. no handwash in toilets. urine and excrement on toilets all the time.
5,2023-12-09,PT feedback,"i first got in touch with sanna for pt sessions at pure gym in february this year and have been working with her ever since. i wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for her dedication and guidance in helping me achieve my fitness goals. i have lost over to 2 stones and my health physically and mentally has improved in so many ways. i just wanted to say her knowledge and expertise have been invaluable to me in this journey, and i appreciate her willingness to tailor workouts to meet my individual needs and abilities. she definitely an asset to pure gym and anyone looking to achieve any fitness goals should get in contact with her."
4,2023-12-11,Friendliest pure needs more space,"the best pure ive been to in terms of staff, friendliness and quality of kit. loses a star for size and business. needs to expand considering how many people it serves and the money spent on membership for this gym."
5,2023-12-05,Lovely Staff and Coach.,"callum is one of the most single handedly nice guys ive ever had as a pt. the bloke genuinely cares and pushes you to an excellent level. ive previously had experiences with trainers who havent necessarily been on the ball in terms of a client/coach relationship and this isnt the case at all with him. props to you dude, top coach so far - give him a good boy sticker pure gym.  also a big thanks to marcy (female manager) who handled a personal situation in the gym amazingly and made me feel comfortable returning to the gym after the incident."
1,2023-12-11,I don't recommend this gym at all,"i dont recommend this gym at all, there a time the boilers was broken down and they still had it open! no staff never to be seen in this gym! equipment out dated yet they want to be charging £22.99 as if they are a flag ship gym in central london! its a standard gym nothing special can see the management have no interest in the standards of this gym and it definitely not being managed well."
5,2023-12-09,Booked on a temporary pass while on…,"booked on a temporary pass while on holiday. great price and will definitely use again. very easy access, car park nearby, clean and bright, good equipment and good atmosphere."
3,2023-12-11,Showers barely Luke warm again and have…,"showers barely luke warm again and have been for several months now, i know you turn the temperature down to try to save on costs but ffs it’s cold outside and a nice hot shower after a workout would be enjoyable   these are hardly slight changes to the water temperature they are big changes and it’s unacceptable to expect people to take cold showers"
5,2023-12-05,I joined this gym under recommendation…,i joined this gym under recommendation from a friend who had lost a lot of weight and reached her target with the help of a personal trainer sanaa. straight from the beginning i felt at ease and comfortable and wasnt worried at all as i have some social anxiety. pt sessions were just as i needed and it was definitely working its treat for my weightloss goals. any ladies out there if you need a female pt please do not shy away from getting ask for sanaa when joining this gym.
1,2023-12-15,Not worth the money,overpriced. its a new gym and very clean but very small. there is a changing area upstairs shared between everybody. there are about 20 small lockers at the most and some shelves to put stuff on but you cant lock it. to change you either need to use toilets or changing cubicles like in shops. there are only 2 cross trainers and about 6 treadmills. also the gym got closed due to facilities issues and there isnt any update on when it will reopen so waste of time and money.
5,2023-12-12,They’re a solid and friendly club and I…,they’re a solid and friendly club and i can only imagine how much they have to control their costs to keep their overheads manageable.  for an online company they have a solid communications architecture so the fact that you can’t call them is forgivable as their email correspondence is very good.
1,2023-12-13,Do not go to PureGym,"(basford) it is a decent gym experience but the machines are clearly very old. it feels cluttered and cramped because of the amount of people. the worst thing by far is the scam that is the resubmission fee. and what makes it worse is that they make it impossible to freeze your account and sort things out. the customer service is hard to get in touch with, making things even more complicated. i would definitely advise people to pick another gym."
5,2023-12-07,Great gym and great staff members,great gym and great staff members. i have came early to the gym twice outside of my off-peak hours since i made a mistake with what hours i should be allowed but the staff still let me in and had informed me of what hours im allowed. i plan on upgrading my membership but will have to wait until the 15th of decembers.  theres a lot of equipments to use and a wide variety of classes that i would like to take part in at some point.
5,2023-12-11,Brilliant gym,the classes are brilliant and staff are friendly and love the  way the managers run the gym the way it should be and rewarded for their standards
5,2023-11-28,Tony Hilton. The Ultimate Guru in training and fitness,"brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work out with this trainer mr tony hilton. he is a great motivator and total inspiration. takes time to engage with every member of the class individually. i thoroughly recommend him. plus he gave me a great personal training package suited to my finances. but his classes are free with the pure bayswater gym membership. ive tried all of his classes from bootcamp to metcon and legs, bums and tums. every class was top notch and mr hilton is  a truly knowledgeable fitness guru and you can tell he lives breathes and eats his work."
2,2023-12-14,PureGym -St George’s (Leicester),"puregym -st george’s (leicester). been a member for almost 6 years. this location, overtime, has declined significantly. many equipment are out of order for a prolonged period of time and the yanga water not available for almost 2 weeks. spoken to staff at the gym and helpdesk. as a paying member it’s not good value for money!"
3,2023-12-09,Big but always something broken,always something broke in this gym it’s usually equipment or the toilets doesn’t seem like there’s any urgency to have it fixed. this week the whole gym has now been closed for 4 days due to flooding of the toilets.  if you walk in on a rainy day expect to have to walk under a water fall then a paddle through the wet carpet  cleaning isn’t amazing and equipment can be a bit nasty  use the toilet before you go in as they are usually broke or in a nasty condition - 2 mens cubicles isn’t really enough especially when one is normally out of order most weeks  don’t leave anything valuable in your locker - mine was broken into even with a padlock and my jacket stolen and the pt couldn’t of been less interested when i made them aware  it’s a big gym with lots of potential but parts of it are always broken.  i’ve given it a 3 for the price and size of the gym … could be a easy 5 if they worked on the same occurring issues.
5,2023-12-12,One of the better pure gyms I've been…,"one of the better pure gyms ive been too, rarely crowded even at the busiest of times! additionally has the necessary equipment."
5,2023-12-16,Helpfull from everything and thanks for…,helpfull from everything and thanks for everyone help me to know all the information ❤️
5,2023-12-12,Highly recommend!,"safe and friendly atmosphere. staff are always friendly, knowledgeable and happy to help. personal trainers are amazing - especially ollie m. as a female, i always feel comfortable and never feel intimidated. recommend to everyone ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
1,2023-12-15,Regarding my previous review.,"regarding my previous review.  i have raised with the gym, i have raised in feedback i have raising the issues with this forum to get them resolved. nothing is resolved!  this forum along with every other channel of feedback is pure gym. you are the same company. the comment still stands and need resolving. please send them on to the gym manager instead of asking me. you’re the same company ??????????"
5,2023-12-11,A really excellent gym and great vfm.,"i joined today, the process was really easy on line and the app works easily to let you in and out of the premises and you can even view how busy it is. you get two hours free parking and there is a ticket validator inside the gym.the gym is large, clean and very well equipped.  there is a wide variety of machines and free weights to suit all tastes plus an exercise floor and a large room for classes.  the mens changing room was clean and had showers and plenty of lockers (bring your own padlock).i was there at about 1130 am and the atmosphere was excellent, no egos, with people just getting on with their workouts.  i met one member of staff and he was really friendly.  this is a really great gym and the price is incredible value for money.i really enjoyed my first session at telford and im looking forward to the next one."
5,2023-12-04,Email channel engagement / Gym equipment,"considering there is no contact centre for this gym, the response time and efficiency of the staff who manage the email communication channel is remarkable. i always get whay i need first time! the only thing i will point out is in the gym, i have noticed a number of pieces of gym equipment out of service. it puts me off going to the gym as this is much smaller than my last gym. it would be good to get these operational more quickly."
3,2023-12-10,Needs a clean and membership review.,"the gym itself it’s alright, there’s a good range of equipment to use and different designated spaces to train away from the equipment.  the 24/7 is a bonus to avoid peak times.  price is reasonable.  the same positives can’t be said about some of the members there clearly not 16+ or just treat the place like an afterschool club. in the evenings, the place is an absolute mess with empty bottles and cans just left on the floors. there doesn’t seem to be any cleaning facilities for members to use either - i appreciate the behaviour of the members isn’t directly pure gyms fault however a lot more to could be done to manage the kids and cleanliness… there clearly isn’t the respect for the environment from all members.  the changing rooms, showers and toilets need a real deep clean. the mens showers and toilets are absolutely rancid and smell of stagnant water and half the locker doors are broken. this could easily be managed by just leaving a bathroom spray cleaner on the wall in the shower so those who want to spray down the shower with some cleaning fluid before and after the shower can do."
5,2023-12-13,Recently join this gym near to where I…,"recently join this gym near to where i work. struck gold! the people are great, so enthusiastic and helpful and the classes are perfect to help keep me in shape! thanks team of st paul’s pure gym."
5,2023-12-03,I’d like to share two reviews,"i’d like to share two separate reviews. one, for my latest pt, cam, who has been guiding me in a 4 weeks programme of specially built for me. not only he’s defined the right exercises, he’s challenged me to improve and build on my achievements. can is such a kind person, easy to talk to, flexible with my lack of practice and always careful with me. i’ve learned a lot of new exercises and managed to improve my confidence in using different equipments. highly recommend cam! thanks a lot! second, regarding the equipment in the gym, can someone please check and speed up fixing what’s broken! i really like the gym, being cosy and friendly. staff is lovely!"
5,2023-12-15,It's a good place to go workout clean…,its a good place to go workout clean all round nice staff there to help with whatever you want or need made some friends
4,2023-12-04,I enjoy using PurGym I do however wish…,i enjoy using purgym i do however wish the keyboard could be made bigger .
5,2023-10-23,Personal Training with Sanna Irfan,"sanna is an amazing pt, she is very knowledgeable, patient and caring. i have thoroughly enjoyed my sessions with her and have definitely learnt a lot. would always recommend her and this gym- the ladies only section is large with plenty of equipment and workout areas."
5,2023-12-07,Wonderful Gym,"i joined up yesterday,the gym is clean & friendly, the mangers & the personal trainers are helpful & knowledgeable, i am glad i am joined up,  this gym is for newbies & the hardcore people"
5,2023-12-16,Always clean and accessible staff are…,always clean and accessible staff are on hand to give advice and assistance.
2,2023-12-11,Not the best,"not the best: first impression was how dark it is inside, there are no windows and barely any mirrors. 3 workouts here to date: it is generally clean but compared with other puregyms the equipment lacks diversity and the layout of machines seems odd. ive often seen people queuing for machines so be prepared to ""freestyle"" your workout due to lack of equipment. ive added this gym on as my secondary gym but personally its not worth the extra £4 p/m. may suit some, but for me its dark and uninspiring."
5,2023-12-04,Great gym!,"bodytone, metcon, spin, circuits, & sweat 30 - ellen, craig, beth (to name but a few!)  great classes, enthusiastic instructors. new refurb looks great too - love the functional area and studio looks fab. thank you :)"
1,2023-12-11,stole £50 and refused to refund,horrible customer service and sneaky terms of conditions. took £50 out of my account and refused to refund even though i had cancelled the membership and not used it. £20 of administration fees is absurd for such a shabby and cheap gym. always missing equipment such as clamps and bars. dumbbells always in wrong places. accessibility to customer support is difficult to find and even when found you are answers by an ai which didn’t even understand what you are asking. just another greedy company i would not recommend.
4,2023-12-09,Great Gym,"been to many gyms and this has got to be one of the better ones. loads of equipment and never had to wait to use anything! only thing i have dropped a star for is the use of cleaning materials, more could be available.."
5,2023-12-01,Love this gym,"love this gym, i’ve been to a few in my life and this is the best. friendly and knowledgeable staff, clean change rooms and equipment. always made to feel welcome."
5,2023-03-31,Personal training with Sanaa arfan,"when i first joined the gym i was so nervous,hesitant and totally out of my comfort zone. i didnt know how to use any of the equipment except one or 2 machines. thats when i decided to start pt sessions with sanaa. she taught me alot and i gained alot of confidence and was in a much better shape and form after training with her so thank you sanaa."
5,2023-12-02,I am so glad that I joined Pure Gym as…,i am so glad that i joined pure gym as i was so nervous and did not know where to start but then i booked sanaa for my pt sessions and have never looked back! each session is well planned and prepared to push you a little further towards your goal. shes amazing at what she does and has great knowledge on how to use the equipment properly. she doesnt just tell you to do an exercise but explains and ensures you know exactly how to get the best out of a workout. she also goes beyond by giving you tips on healthy eating. thankyou for everything.
2,2023-12-12,"Okay gym, awful classes","ive been a customer here for over a year now, and the gym is pretty good, well equipped and does the job. my main review is for the pts who lead the sessions - either theyre not trained or shouldnt be supported to run classes. sessions where the trainer is 1) underprepared to lead (not knowing what exercises come next), 2) demotivated (barely engaging with customers / going on phones), and 3) not being attentive to attendees (playing random music / not speaking) should not be paid for. im sure that theyre great people and i realise that this isnt a luxury gym experience - but these are some bare minimum things that have gone unchanged for the better part of a year. please do better, puregym!"
1,2023-12-09,I wasn't going to write a review until…,i wasnt going to write a review until i saw the clearly fake 4 & 5 star reviews below.  this gym is by far the busiest ive ever witnessed (like unsafe busy). you will queue for nearly all machines and someone will then be waiting for you to finish. your workout will be defined by what equipment is available.  side note: why do so many young teenagers hangout here socialising in groups? they dont even exercise.  anyone willing to open an alternative low-cost franchise gym in leamington spa or warrick would make bank.
5,2023-11-26,A gym that isn’t scary!,"southport gym… i have always been someone who has been a bit terrified of the gym and haven’t been to one for years! everyone is lovely and welcoming, ready to help you if you need it. it’s helped me to feel more confident in the gym, especially knowing i can ask for help if i ever need it. absolutely nothing intimidating about the place and i really don’t know why i was worried!"
5,2023-12-12,Great gym,"great gym, friendly environment, staff are very helpful and there’s a lot of equipment available."
1,2023-12-13,Booked Absolute Abs class from 1845 to…,"booked absolute abs class from 1845 to 1915 on 13th dec 2023 , its gone past time and no instructor was present ,  when i went and enquired - i was told that class was cancelled. 100% unprofessional. this is at puregym dudley!"
4,2023-12-01,Showers are way too cold,"enjoy using this branch of puregym and i understand that youre trying to keep your overheads down etc. but the temperature of the showers is really not good at all. it may be fine for most members, but if youre like myself and have painful arthritic hands and back, they are unbelievably unpleasant to use, due to the lower temperature. not everyone can go shower at home and they should be useable by all members."
2,2023-12-13,Overpriced,"i was so excited about this gym but its not worth the value. new, nicely built, unfortunately very overpriced gym. we appreciate the welcome price but thats the catch! final basic price: £32.99 !  the constructed layout is small, expected much bigger space for the price. too much wasted space and unorganised positions for the machines. missing 1-10kg dumbbell set by the free weight. missing some key machines: biceps curl, triceps press, lat pulldown, lateral raise, calf press, hack squat and very low amount of cardio machines for this price. good amount of cable crossovers, good amount of functional stuff, 3 deadlift rack which could have been 6 if you move it and use the back side too...  ive been to some puregyms which are cheaper and bigger in the area - dont understand why this one is so high priced. maybe the 24/7 access, but thats not compensating the issues i just mentioned.  i really hope you consider and act on my advise. lower the price or add more stuff!"
5,2023-12-07,I'm in my own little world here,"im in my own little world here, surrounded by wonderful people and i even feel im making progress lol. i recommend anyone and everyone to give it a go"
1,2023-12-12,Long term member,"long term member. 24hr gym, my daughter went to gym before work arrived at 5:15am left at 5:47am and got a £100 parking ticket. the car park is open, no barriers etc, and is used for puregym, homebase and mcdonalds. and for some reason looking at the small print that you can not see in the dark says no parking between 00.30 & 5:30am. there is no reason to have those restrictions in that car park apart from making money from people who use the gym in those hours. purgym should make it clear on the website no parking available between hours stated above."
1,2023-09-07,"not suitable for a white working class….racist undertones unwelcoming for white males ,SAD FACTS not opinions","not suitable for a white working class male to enter, was virtually marched out by management ridiculed and abused ,h.r said sorry and offered me £ 10 pound discount shameful place my ethnicity was not welcome ...sad sad place for a silver medalist gracie jujitsu fighter.terrible experience would not advise any white person to enter here .if you do you will feel the facts.  shameful place as other pure gyms are excellent and welcoming and professional.....this is not suitable for white people .simple."
5,2023-12-08,Had a great Box Fit class with Kyle,had a great box fit class with kyle.  really encouraging and a well thought out group of exercises. definitely be back to his classes when i can attend.
5,2023-12-09,I had an amazing experience in Burnham,"i had an amazing experience with jelenas pump class! jelenas energy and enthusiasm are contagious, making each session not just a workout, but a fun and empowering experience. her personalized approach and clear instruction helped me push my limits. i highly recommend her pump class for anyone looking to challenge themselves and enjoy a dynamic workout with a fantastic trainer!"
5,2023-12-04,getting PIN number,hadn’t had an email with my pin so tried emailing with no luck however messaged on the socials and they were super friendly and my pin was sent to me right away
2,2023-12-11,Scam when freezing membership,"i feel totally scammed by puregym, i’ve just had an accident and can’t do workouts for a month. i remember my bill date was on mid-december, i rushed to freeze my membership but turns out that you need to do it around 4 days earlier, so need to pay this month as usual and next with the freeze price, what doesn’t help. i got so annoyed that tried to cancel my membership for good but they don’t even allow you to do it till your bill date has passed by some days so they can make sure you can’t claim it back through your bank. i can’t believe they trick the app this way so you can’t basically do anything when all subscriptions nowadays allow you to even cancel the day before of your bill date. they got my money for this month but it will be the last, there’re more gyms in the area that are about same prices and not that crowded and probably not that dirty.. you will never see any cleaning around. also it’s bloody cold in there, try to have a shower in winter time there.."
5,2023-12-11,Great welcome & introduction,"very helpful introduction from andy. good, clean environment. seems to be well set up."
2,2023-12-13,Not as good,"a bit on a small side same changing rooms for male and female? big no for me! only 20 or so lockers and half of them are already taken by people who keep their stuff over the night. pls do not do that, take your gym bag with you when u leaving and free the lockers! some equipment still missing , not so many machines…. no cleaning stations no sanitising sprays to clean sweaty benches /equipment. it is really uncomfortable and makes you feel bad when you have to use dirty bench covered in sweat. and when gym is closed due to unforeseen circumstances should we not get an email for how long or when will it be reopen? comparing to other pure gyms this one not doing that well.."

5,2023-12-02,Great gym - recommend it,"just joined this new gym and been there twice. staff are very welcoming, friendly and supportive. the actual place is really nice, they have a separate spacious room for classes. something that i would improve is: more small weights (there’s only 2sets of 5kg) and more mirrors 😂."
4,2023-12-03,PureGym Elgin Grand opening 1st…,"puregym elgin grand opening 1st december- long awaited.  a few months ago i received a flyer in the post about joining a new gym in elgin and also via my vitality life insurance i noticed discounts so i took the plunge to join. i turned up on sunday after lunch to avoid the masses and i must admit i was surprised. a very welcoming floor manager open to questions greeted me at the door and i had a look on what was available. different zones like cardio, strength conditioning and a floor space for classes. facilities seemed very accommodating and accessible for people with additional needs.  it’s open 24rs a day which will suit people that perhaps are shift workers or work outside normal 9-5 work. overall a good experience on a quiet sunday. perhaps peak times are more challenging. overall…first impression is good.  price - very good at just £16 month via vitality and i can take a guest 4x per month. parking - ample amount of “ free “ parking. staff - friendly, approachable and helpful. w/c shower facilities- ample and comfortable. cleanliness- top … can’t complain.  negative- didn’t see a cleaning station to clean down machines after use . suggest bringing own cleaning supplies."
4,2023-12-08,the price,the price for the access to the gym especially the 24-hour one is quite reasonable compared to other gyms that ive inquired u
4,2023-12-08,as a guest,i go occasionally as a guest.  lot of the equipment is suited to me.  i like the ski bit thats different.  cool room is good for winding down where theres no pressure.
5,2023-12-05,Gym is fab love it,"puregym stafford is fab love it! only complaint is the yanga machine isn’t working and i have paid for as a bolt on. other than that, friendly and great workout environment"
1,2023-12-12,the gym & class offer is basic,"the staff are lovely. but, the gym itself is very basic and the offer of classes is very thin on the ground. one of pure gyms biggest selling points is the ‘over 50 free classes’ line which features outside the gym along the wall. yet there are maybe 5 or 6 classes a day at most. the classes that are always full have not once been increased in number and popular classes have been reduced to 30 min classes to 15 minutes and now are not available at all. i’m basically paying a monthly fee for access to a treadmill and some weights - very much not the pure gym sell. very disappointing. in addition, the culture perpetuated by some of the young men in this gym is also completely unacceptable and has no place in a modern society. women should feel safe in the gym and able to mind their own business. sadly this doesn’t seem to be the case in this one. the solution is not ‘female only spaces’ it should be a zero tolerance policy led by pure gym."
2,2023-12-06,Freezing showers no repair in sight,"showers have been broken (freezing) for months, never actually been hot in the ladies for the 2 years + i’ve been a member.  now sourcing an alternative gym to join as i need to get clean after training.  such a shame puregym corporate don’t care about their clients as the staff at andover are lovely but can’t do anything about the gym failures such as broken equipment, ablutions, wifi without some corporate authority which is never forthcoming."

1,2023-12-04,There never seems to be any hot water…,"there never seems to be any hot water for the showers. the men’s changing rooms had even lost 3 showers. i assume due to cost saving, which is another issue as you stand in a cold changing room waiting for an available shower. non the less surely it’s a legal requirement to provide a certain level of warms in a place open to paying members of the public. with saving money not refitting and blocking off three showers surely there is a few pennys more in the jar for some warmer air and water?"
2,2023-12-17,Caution with PT's,"the gym itself i cant fault. very clean, to a good standard and well maintained.  however, take caution if you are considering hiring one of the pts there (i wont say who, due to it being there being an ongoing investigation regarding this pt).  the pt i hired promised, for £233 a month, 8 sessions and a fitness plan i could follow. however, this was not delivered. the in-person sessions completely contradicted the online sessions set, the diet plan was completely off from what i needed, the supplements didnt match to watch i stipulated (i told the pt i couldnt take creatine, yet the diet plan heavily relied on it) and i ended up with several injuries as a result of the exercises set-the reason i hired a pt was so i could recover from injuries, among other things.  the pt only delivered on 4 booked sessions, of the 8 promised. i met them for a 5th, however i wont count that one, he cancelled the booked one at short notice, and rearranged it for a time that was completely unsuitable. even though i attended, i only completed about half of it because i ended up with an injury, because he booked a running session the day after another running session, as the pt hadnt checked the online sessions he had set for me. i ended up not being able to rest my legs.  i didnt hear anything after that from the pt for over a week. i was surprised to find the pt had charged me for another month, with no direct debit set up, no subscription agreement set up, nor had the pt asked whether i wanted another month. the pt hadnt delivered on one months worth of sessions.  were now nearly 3 weeks since i had the money taken out, and the pt has still to book a session or even contact me. the clearly never intended on delivering a session this month.  ive tried contacting puregym, and making them aware of the situation. the pt is still operating at the gym, and the issue is still not resolved. i havent really heard from anyone, beyond the odd email to state they were aware. im not the sort to publicly shame, and i was prepared to give the gym time to resolve this issue. however, as i havent heard anything, i dont have much of a choice."
2,2023-12-10,"Poor gym etiquette, Norwich Aylsham Road","the gym itself is okay, could benefit from an extra leg machine (e.g.: hack squat) and a better calf raise machine (e.g.: standing straight leg). lockers are only outside changing rooms which was annoying at the start but i got used to it after a couple of months.  the biggest issue i have with this gym is the fact that most of the equipment always has plates on it. most people do not bother putting weights back. i have been to a large number of other gyms in norwich (including other puregym in castle mall), other cities and countries, and ive never seen it that bad. the culture in this gym is really poor, and the management needs to do something about it, there are ways to encourage/remind of positive and responsible behaviour. as of now, a lot of people have zero respect for the place, the equipment, and the people who will be using said equipment after theyre done. imagine your young sister or (grand)mother joining the gym and not being able to use half of the machines because they got 20/25kg plates all over which they cannot remove themselves safely. really, really poor."

1,2023-12-14,Cancelling membership is scam,"they make it impossible to cancel your membership. you click on cancel membership button and theres a link on ""information on process of cancelling your membership"" that link tells you to go to the cancel membership button from where you just came and you are told to follow the instructions. which are go and press that button that says follow the instructions to press the button that tells you to follow the instructions to press the button that tells you to follow the instructions to press the button .."

4,2023-12-01,Kudos to PureGym,a big kudos to puregym management to take immediate action on back of my comments in trustpilot to not just to improve the shower area but refurbishing the entire men’s changing room to give it a fresh look! the success and failure of any business depend on how seriously and constructively the management take customer feedback so well done to puregym!
1,2023-11-27,Lake of classes,"i joined this gym in october and by mid november work started to improve the gym which is a good thing however what this means is that from the last few weeks in november till what seems like mid december there are no classes, the only§ reason i joined the gym is for the classes. to date no one has been able to tell me when classes will resume, i think the least that can be done is keep their members informed. i don’t see why i should be paying membership for a gym i can’t attend because they are not providing classes. yes i know i can go to another puregym, however these are not necessarily convenient for me nor do they offer the classes i want at the same time as the edgware classes."

2,2023-12-03,Very inconsistent with classes,very inconsistent with classes. instructors aren’t good at all and if there’s lesser people for a class they won’t do it sometimes and don’t even notify in advance. the only great class is pilates at puregym bayswater. really need to get better instructors and classes or don’t have them!
2,2023-11-19,I didn't even get to join,"i didnt even get to join, i emailed the gym weeks ago to arrange to view, because when i popped in and rang the bell no one answered. i wanted to check before i joined that the gym had majority working equiptment, was clean and wanted to enquire about pt. had no reply. from the negative reviews left on here the reply from managent seemed to over look imporntant issues raised and not reassure me this is is a well managed gym. so sadly ill have to try another. again your reply tells me to get in touch doesnt actually address my issue. i already got in touch on 19th and you ignored it."

(what a great customer response). we are now into the winter period and you would expect the water temperature to be improved now we are in the colder periods of the year. it would be a good idea for an employee to check this out for themselves as its not like this in other puregyms i have been too."

1,2023-12-13,Not worth the price & lack of customer service,"i was so excited about puregym opening as it’s a 2 minute walk from my house and i can quickly go home and shower and go straight to work.  that was the only reason i joined as i was a member with the gym group and cannot fault their service.  the second reason i joined is they were having a promotional offer of £16.99 ( if you joined before they opened ) for the first six months and then the price increases to £32.99!  puregym need to rethink this price increase as members want value for money and they aren’t providing this.  for example: the constructed layout is small, and i expected a much bigger space for the price. there is too much wasted space and the deadlift rack could have been 6 instead of three and there are no mirrors by this area so you can’t see a side angle.  in addition the way the back extension has been positioned you can’t see a side angle as there is only one long mirror by the dumbbells and you don’t have a front view as it’s been placed in front of a pillar.  i discovered that the cable machines had the wrong stickers on each of the weights so if you thought you were choosing 2.3kg for example it was really 4.3kg. there should have been a sign informing members about this.  where the landline is positioned they have placed a carpet by the window / open doors so if it rains the water comes through and makes the carpet extremely wet.  i discovered this as i was using the landmine in a seated position and my tracksuit bottoms were soaked. i informed the manager and no sign was placed to inform other members.  whoever designed the gym left out critical elements. this gym is missing some key machines: biceps curl, triceps press, lat pulldown, lateral raise, calf press, hack squat and there is a very low amount of cardio machines for this price. for example there is only one upright bike.  there is a good amount of cable machines, but i couldn’t believe they don’t provide a cable straight bar which is the most used attachment for cable machines and a narrow grip landmine handle & row attachment. this is shocking. there is a good amount of functional stuff and that’s about it.  when puregym opened its doors to the public the first thing i was shocked about was the fact that the changing area, toilets/showers and lockers are all on the same floor and shared between men and women.  there aren’t enough lockers for members and they have also provided open shelves for people to put their possessions in which is ridiculous as there is a sign that says puregym can’t be held accountable for anything that goes missing. why didn’t they just provide more lockers?  my frustrations have increased as they opened on the 01/12/2023 and closed 13/12/2023 and didn’t send an email out to members telling us. i found out by going to the gym and seeing a sign saying the place has shut down due to a facilities issue and to use the closest gym to me.  this is a joke as the main reason i joined was the close proximity and the closest to me would be crouch hill, finsbury park or muswell hill which means an additional cost to pay for transport and the distance doesn’t work for me.  when i contacted customer service the only option i was given was to freeze my membership which i would have to pay £6.99 for each month.  i find this preposterous as no emails have been sent out to update members as to when the gym will open again. i could pay £6.99 to freeze my membership and they open tomorrow. we’ve been told to just keep an eye out for an email. this is shocking.  the gym group never do this. they give you a timeframe and keep you updated constantly. if i’m made to pay to freeze my membership i’m cancelling my membership. i feel a lot of members will leave after the first six months as the price increase doesn’t reflect the quality of this gym."

1,2023-11-30,Customers… an inconvenience.,"this company deliberately refuses to engage other than through a chat service which promises a reply ‘usually within 12 hours’.  they’ve chosen not to bother having phone lines.  they don’t provide up-to-date information about sudden, unexpected, and in the end unexplained, closures of some gyms.  those are the signs of a cash cow, not a company with any concern for its customers."
1,2023-11-29,Poor maintenance & poor Sanitary,"the gym has no toilet or shower for a week now & no sign it will bother to repair. in fact if anything breakdown in this gym, it will not get repaired for months. the air conditioning leaks in summer & blows cold air in winter. the weights are left all over the place & the toilets often run out of toilet paper. this is cheap gym, and it shows."
2,2023-11-30,Air conditioning,"i like this gym but huge problem is it’s really cold here. air conditioning is working for sure,  but i think it’s not necessary on almost december. more useful would be air circulation, because if is bigger number of people is no air to breathe. glass wall are steamy really easy and it effects floor next to it is well. so it you don’t want change carpets in the closest future, because you are looking for savings, do something with it please. as i talked with people it’s not only me and it cause they don’t want to be a members. it’s a shame became it’s a really good gym."
3,2023-09-01,Gym in the Cold 5th Gen War,"i’d been a member since the gym opened, transferred from north harbour. the shower temperature was reduced to an uncomfortable level, my monthly fee was increased. there’s too much virtue signalling, government propaganda and corporate advertising pumping out over the tannoy. welcome to gym orwell’s 1984 style. i’m done with them, bye"
5,2023-11-30,A Welcoming Atmosphere and Excellent Value,"i want to say a big thank you to the puregym leytonstone team for creating a welcoming environment. the staff are generally friendly and always ready to lend a hand – major kudos to them! the facilities are great, with well-kept gear and a spacious setup that suits all fitness lovers. the value for money is good, especially compared to other pricier spots ive hit up before. i used to drop three times the cash on memberships at city gyms only to find outdated equipment and a less-than-cosy vibe. i did read some reviews here mentioning missing paper towels and cleanliness issues. sure, it does get hectic during peak hours, but thats expected when a place is this popular and affordable. i reckon its also on us gym-goers to keep things tidy and not add to the chaos when staff is not around. i also want to give a big shoutout to the management team. theyve always been extremely helpful in finding my lost items...perfume & airpods a few times... always quick and on point! to sum it up, this place isnt just budget-friendly; its also a safe and cosy spot to get your fitness on. massive thanks to the whole crew for making my gym experience positive! 🙌"

5,2023-11-29,Great experience,"i have had bayswater puregym membership for almost a year now and i have only good things to say! i was a bit intimidated in the beginning as i am not used to going to the gym alone and lifting weights but the staff there is incredibly friendly and helpful. they also have great facilities and space. something for everyone - lots of dumbbells and variety of machines, cardio space, stretching and dynamic training areas. every now and then i like to do a class and these are fun too as you can feel that the instructors are genuinely putting effort to make the class enjoyable for everyone. the only thing to be aware of is that it gets a bit busy during peak hours (6-7pm) but i feel like that happens in every gym. also so far everyone has been friendly to share the equipment if needed and you can look from the app how many people are in the gym and when it’s the busiest. so would be smart to work around that if possible."
1,2023-11-29,No hot water for 3 months!,no hot water for 3 months. it’s freezing outside!
1,2023-11-01,I'm truly devastated by the current…,"im truly devastated by the current state of the gym. for the past month, something has felt off – its dirty, the changing rooms are unpleasant, and most machines are broken. it seems like theres no visible management, and the gym feels like its running without direction. the shocking part is the terrible attitude of the assistant manager, who only treats her clients well, leaving others feeling mistreated. her leadership style is unacceptable, and the position should be given to someone else. additionally, the lift, crucial for individuals with mobility issues, has been out of order for months without anyone addressing the issue. this drastic decline in the gyms quality within a month is truly disheartening. theres a plea for better treatment of members, as other gyms would gladly welcome them."

5,2023-11-29,My personal trainer,"my personal trainer, cam, is honestly the only reason i was able to get into the gym again. i was struggling with getting into coming to the gym but it was always a goal of mine to do. the first ever time i came to pure gym i had signed myself up for a lbt class and i wasnt able to do some of the exercises everyone else was doing. cam was so supportive and thought of exercises on the spot for me to do so i could still take part, ever since then ve been having 2 sessions a week with him working on my body goals. he has honestly been amazing, so non-judgmental, friendly, easy going/easy to talk to, knows literally everything there is to know about the sport sciences and pushes me to my limits to help better myself! he creates such a positive environment and now instead of being scared to come to the gym, im excited. honestly without cam i would’ve given up a long time ago."

1,2023-11-22,Dirty,mens changing rooms are disgusting. holes in the wall where someone has punched it. dirty and smell awful. the gym is really busy in peak times. i wont be renewing my membership.
2,2023-11-23,Spin Bikes,"whilst the spin instructors are all very good,the bikes are all in a terrible state. it seems to be a running joke rather than something that needs to be addressed. even the instructors are frustrated with the bike situation. all of them are rusty and have some issues. please get this sorted pure gym."
4,2023-11-28,First visit,first visit and pleasantly surprised. gym seems well equipped and was well presented.
4,2023-11-25,Nice variety of equipment available,"nice variety of equipment available, plenty of locker spaces and excellent value for money particularly with the introductory offer. changing facilities are ok, however showers could be a tad warmer. some bicycle racks outside would improve things."
1,2023-11-28,One star is generous,"one star is generous, i’ve really tried to give this gym a chance but it gets worse every week. the gym itself is filthy and the machines are always breaking, this i could tolerate but after having some of my belongings stolen while they were “safe” in a locker i’m not sure i’ll ever return. staff are keenly aware that people are having things stolen frequently but don’t really seem bothered. roid heads and thieves, proper joke."
1,2023-11-28,Absolutely disappointed with this gym…,absolutely disappointed with this gym false advertising i signed up with plus membership to be able to use other gyms checked i could use borehamwood as live in watford but work in borehamwaood now it should i could. i tried to use the gym in borehamwood i couldn’t get in and received a texts saying i can’t use this gym and on the puregym app it won’t let me change anything . so all in all a big waste of time and money

5,2023-11-27,Cheap and cheerful,cheap and cheerful friendly staff 5 stars
1,2023-11-27,Terrible company,"terrible company. just take money out of your account without your permission. i shared my concerns with the current state of the gym and the manager but nothing changed.   puregym snowhill id question who is giving this gym such good reviews, especially on cleanliness. personal trainers and staff maybe?  this gym is below the standard of others ive used within the chain. the personal trainers are needless arrogant and uninspiring. the equipment is old, rusting and stinks. although there are products to clean the equipment after use by its members this is ultimately the responsibility of the cleaners however, the cleaners spend more time on their phones in the changing rooms than they do cleaning, and pushing a vacuum around is about as much as they do, theres never any soap to wash your hands and when there is, the soap dispensers are broken for weeks on end, this only seems to have been an issue since mid-2022/2023 so i’d question the management of the place. chewing gum is stuck to carpets it cant be that hard to notice! is it that hard to monitor the cleanliness and safety of the equipment?  every personal trainer must have a disability in this gym as they use the only disabled toilet for members that need it, evidently because its more convenient than walking up 3 steps to the changing room 10 feet away.  if this gym wasnt so close to where i live id have left by now."
5,2023-11-27,Management  do not stop working very…,management  do not stop working very approachable 2
4,2023-11-18,Cheap and easy to access but parking is crap,"cheap and easy to access. clean but parking is a faff because it’s run by some independent company, and so only 2hs free. normally fine until the gym is rammed and to get a workout plus stretching with everything being used means going over that time is likely. been fined for going a mere ten minutes over the time limit"
1,2023-05-31,Machine built incorrectly,"i was really enjoying this gym but the hip adductor/abductor machine has the handles bolted on the wrong way, so when your legs part, they hit the handles, the handles should be flush with the seat not interfering with your movement. i got sick of it bruising my thighs.  i told the gym via instagram which they read on 31st may, they still havent changed it. i havent been since due to not being able to complete my legs workout.  its literally 4 bolts to undo it then turn it the right way!"
1,2023-11-27,Hello,"hello  i joined the puregym bedford nearly three months ago. my first payment included so called admin fee and other fees, the second payment for the monthly was suppose to be £18.99 they took £51,99 with no reason, my complaints have been ignored, the gym manager states this is a customer services issue contact the puregym customer services on member,service email which gives you get an automatic response stating we our sorry you are leaving our gym, so i just ignored the cost and got on with it, this month they took £36.99. i stopped my gym direct debit they then cancelled my gym membership despite having paid, again i spoke with the gym team and again they pointed me towards the email previously mentioned, puregym more like purecon. £115 for three month membership when the gym membership was suppose to be £18.99. stay well clear"
2,2023-11-27,"Dirty, busy and machines out of order for long periods","a certain gym machine has been out of order for 3+ weeks and there is only one of this specific machine in this puregym, meaning i’ve had to skip the exercise from my routine for 3 weeks. the gym is busy all the time and it is hard to use equipment without waiting for ages. changing rooms/toilets always stink and are kept it a bad condition."
4,2023-11-27,very easy access,"very easy access, nice modern equipment, plenty of space to body weight train and stretch."

5,2023-11-27,Great,"clean, friendly and non-toxic atmosphere.  staff helpful."
5,2023-11-27,Angel at PureGym South is THE BEST,i can’t thank angel enough for how much she has helped me on my health journey. before i started training with her i had a horrible relationship with food and didn’t understand at all what my body needed. i remember some days i would consume less than 1000 calories and view it as a victory. i’m really glad i’m no longer in that place. she’s also helped me not be afraid of lifting heavy in fear of becoming too “bulky”. i’ve never felt stronger since training with her and could not recommend her enough to anyone who’s looking to be a healthier and more confident version of themselves :)
5,2023-11-27,All staff at site are always helpful…,"all staff at site are always helpful and friendly. such a pity though that some gym members still fail to wipe down equipment after use and this therefore reflects on the cleanliness which is by no means a reflection on staff not doing their jobs. cycle is one of my most loved studio activity and a shame that there are not more bikes so classes need not have long waiting lists. again the cycle classes are varied, super fun and challenging."
5,2023-02-18,Really friendly staffs,"really friendly staffs, well managed equipment and lots of variety of exercises and workout to choose from."
5,2023-11-16,Great gym,"i use this gym two days a week when i’m in the office and i love it. the staff (especially the two female pts and the guy with longer hair) are super friendly and the changing rooms/gym are pretty clean and everything works/gets fixed quickly. it doesn’t feel clicky or intimidating. i prefer this so much to my local one as the atmosphere is so much better, it’s not as busy and the staff are so much friendlier.  i am actually considering driving out on my wfh days as it’s that much better. the only thing i’d change is the heating is just a bit too high, it would be great if they could turn it down a little."
5,2023-11-24,Excellent equipment and always available,excellent equipment and always available. very good price for off peak membership
5,2023-11-27,Excellent range and availability..,"excellent range and availability of equipment (superb matrix kit), good environment, friendly, clean, good changing facilities and showers."
4,2023-11-26,Strength 30,"parsa runs a fantastic strength 30 class on sunday mornings. he puts alot of effort in organising the various stations. however 30 minutes is too short, can it be extended to 45 minutes please 🙏."
3,2023-11-26,Quality of equipment,emailed about equipment being out of order at the beginning of the month. got a reply about the staff doing regular maintenance checks yet almost 4 weeks later that piece of equipment is out of order. other pieces of equipment are also damaged and not useable. i don’t see any change in the quality of the equipment.  also on entrance the front door to get into the gym is broken and has been for the last week. not very secure when using late at night when you you’re meant to use your code to get in

5,2023-11-26,Great gym,"great atmosphere, equipment and staff. classes are great. its clean and kept tidy by the staff who are great. theyre always willing to offer advice on training and nutrition. my only niggle is groups of youngsters gathering round one machine....usually at peak time so 5pm til 7pm....on their mobile phones! theyre happy to move aside if asked. apart from that its a great gym."
5,2023-11-26,So glad I joined,"was sceptical but friends encouraged me to join & i am so glad i did, love it! mainly do classes which are great, love that there are short classes that still get you working hard so can fit them in even when busy. staff that i have dealt with are great. petes classes are great, especially love bootcamp sundays! have never felt better about myself"

2,2023-11-25,They need to employ a cleaner,"they need to employ a cleaner, theres been someones dirty tissue and the same mess on the floor for 4 days now in and around the leg press upstairs, i dread to think how many germs are on the machines if they cant even clean up large items. also the cover on the leg extension needs replacing, the raw edge of the split cover hurts the back of your legs."

5,2023-11-25,Right for me.,"i’ve been a member for about 4 years, i use it every day, i tried every gym in halifax with a open mind, the right gym for me is a essential part of my life, when choosing price either way wasn’t going to be the deciding factor (within reason),they all had pluses and minuses, i came here at a challenging time in my life and began to rebuild things one day at a time, i stayed here because it’s a effortless experience, nothing daunting about it, location, parking, ease of entry, atmosphere, equipment, members, staff ect. it’s a spacious, bright and fresh place with a wall of glass letting plenty of natural light in, i feel settled and comfortable there, i wouldn’t change something that works so well. wass"
2,2023-11-24,Water problem,"hi, i recently became member of pure gym. i had two classes and i really liked, the instructors were great. but on the downside when i went to have a shower, there was no hot water. this was a really inconvenient for me because i had to go to work straight after. i would like to know when this problem will be fixed as i do not think it is right to advertise something and then you don’t provide it."
3,2023-11-23,Recently redecorated and more space,"much better now areas of the gym have been redecorated and repaired, and glad not to be facing those cardio machines as you enter/leave changing rooms, where there is more space. top floor small studio seems less cluttered with rubber flooring now removed. also new sprint track flooring has been fitted. its clear new management team have made a difference, and are doing a great job so far."
5,2023-11-24,Personal Training,"personal training, good equipment and a good price"
1,2023-11-24,Cleanliness of lockers,"cleanliness i have been going to puregym for a few years and i still enjoy it  but there are always improvements to be made.    i dont think the lockers in puregym have ever been cleaned.    inside puregym gym lockers they are filthy dirty, full of dust, bacteria especially on the door of each locker.   surprisingly managers, regional managers walk around and dont see these problems.   when the lockers are not damaged,in which 50% are damaged, at least they are all very dirty inside."

5,2023-11-23,A gym for all abilities and disciplines,"i like the triangle at bournemouth. easy to walk to in 20 minutes for me because it’s central. the resistance and cardio machines are clean and in good condition. the free weights, benches and smith are clean and in good condition. atmosphere is friendly but you can get on and do your workout without interruptions. in the mornings is easy to access all the kit you need without waiting. a gym for all abilities and all disciplines. definitely recommend."

3,2023-11-22,Been coming here for 3 years and now…,"been coming here for 3 years and now and only now i feel that they have given me a reason to make a complaint/review… first and foremost it’s a good gym hence i been coming here for the past 3 years though i do use rippedgym as well, secondly i don’t understand the ventilation process in the gym, recently they have bolted all the windows and no air con around the treadmills which i just admit it’s not only unhygienic but also very uncomfortable when you are in mid run and need a fresh of air, we aren’t in prison for the windows to be bolted nor are we in a sauna for there to be so much heat/no ventilation. completely wrong so i hope the manager can do something about this because it’s poor period!!"
4,2023-11-23,Nice and serene environ,"nice and serene environ, but sometimes customers left equipments unclean after use."
5,2023-11-22,Darren Strength and Abs,"lovely classes run by darren tonight. strength 30 followed by absolute abs. strength 30 is brilliant, week on week darren keeps the excerises fresh and varied so you get a different work out each time. cracking finisher of a longest wall sit getting the class to compete with each other tonight. followed by absolute abs this is a perfect combo for a full body blast. from planks to bicycle crunches..... them abs definitely got a blast. darren always brings full encouragement support and keeps each week fresh. he is very good with his member interaction and takes time to help member and check in when required."
3,2023-11-22,Rubbish customer service,cant really comment on the gym but rubbish customer service.  no way to speak to anyone on the telephone and they dont reply to emails.  they say its easy to cancel the membership online but not in my experience.
1,2023-11-21,Terrible experience shower temperature…,terrible experience shower temperature set at luke warm 33 degrees . this is 4.5 degrees below body temperature and is totally unacceptable. complained but response basically from customer service was dismissive and a barely warm shower was company policy . will probably cancel membership and join a new gym opening in december in bromley!
1,2023-11-22,Overcrowded gym & unpleasant trainers,"made it 5 minutes late to the first & last class i booked with pure gym (i prefer just using weights usually) because of a bus delay and was told to leave the class. cancelling my membership right after posting this review because this is no proper way to treat a paying customer. lateness of 15 min + i’d understand, but for 5 minutes you’re just being unpleasant for the sake of it.  the trainer justified this by saying i missed the warm-up but the class itself was packed to the brim and if you read the other low star reviews you can easily see they are not managing booking properly so let’s be honest here about what the issue is. any respectable venue would check names before allowing attendees in the class and would give a 5 minutes grace for entrance. back to nuffield i go.  other complaints are: equipment being broken fairly frequently and taking a while to fix venue smelling bad generally - makes you wonder about hygiene standards severe overcrowding at peak times - i understand it’s a budget gym and i guess this comes with the territory (and it’s indeed why i decided to try out a class this time around because it’d be a challenge to secure a squat rack at this time - 6.30pm on a wednesday)  this review pertains to the legs, abs & tums class of wednesday 22nd november 6.30pm. toodles!  p.s. i’d appreciate it if the venue didn’t respond to tell me how “popular” pure gyms venues are as it did to the other low rating reviews. it’s a budget gym that allows oversubscription and has poor booking management, not the most popular girl in class. be so for real. cute public perception management attempt, i suppose."

1,2023-11-22,NO HOT WATER AGAIN!,i am having to write a review again because it seems like this is the only way they will fix things. the showers have been out of order for few weeks due to a hot water issue. they have said this issue has been resolved last week but when using the showers the water is ice cold and now there is barely any water pressure at all and instead its gone worse. people that use the showers in the morning like myself have work to go to after and this is a huge inconvenience as i am paying for my membership and not getting the full amenities. also this problem has been going on for a long time over a year and especially gets worse in the winter as it seems like they are trying to skimp on the hot water as in the summer it is always hot?
5,2023-10-15,Excellent,excellent. great place to work out
1,2023-11-14,Average gym,"good business model, an average gym. has the atmosphere of being in a 24hr supermarket at 3 am. it makes rules like no bags or to wear footwear but none of the staff will say anything because they are doing their main gig of personal training.  machines constantly out of use and no hot water for well over a week."
4,2023-11-22,Great gym,"great gym. love the women only section, give me a confident boost to workout more. good variety of class available and welcoming staff.  the temperature of the showers in the gym is the only down point. it just above luke warm at times. really needs improving."

2,2023-11-01,Average at best,"the staff including the management just hang around a desk most of the time laughing and joking. what do these people actually do? the changing rooms are not warm enough, the lockers are monopolised by people locking them and leaving the premises. this is not checked by the staff despite the website stating that they do this every night. music is too loud. the wifi provided does connect but signal is poor. its okay for the price but not well managed. changing rooms are a bit unclean. also the off peak hours are not the same as what is stated on the website they are 30 minutes later."

2,2023-11-14,Machine hoggers,"the cable machine is by far the most popular in this gym, all four machines are always occupied no matter the time of day (i train outside peak hours). the users hog them for long periods of time. last week i asked a young lad who had already been on for 20mins how many more sets he had and got ""quite a few, this is the only machine i like to use here."" i did say that it was unfair on other users and he shrugged the comment off. then you have groups of guys hogging the machines together for ages. short of physically dragging someone off, what are customers meant to do; constantly snitch to staff? its either time to invest in a timer say 10mins max per user or to purchase more of these machines replacing less popular ones. if its not adressed ill just cancel my membership."
5,2023-11-19,Excellent run gym,manager claire and assistant manager mike do an excellent job of making members feel part of a community at harrogate puregym. their enthusiasm and hard work really shows. nothing is too much trouble and they and all the staff do everything they can to make sure the gym runs in the best possible way.

1,2023-11-18,Update: And still the most foul-smelling Gym in Halifax!,"the puregym communications manager said this: (15 november 2023 email.) “although we have been having issues with the air conditioning, there is still ventilation in the gym, which has been checked and confirmed as operational.” i went the gym on the 18thnovember, as i entered the pod, i could feel the heat from the gym and the stench was sickening. be truthful, the place stinks and has done for many months. fellow gym members are prepared to substantiate the claims made here if requested. at low levels, stale air is uncomfortable, but at higher levels, stale air can become unhealthy. breathing in unhealthy levels of stale air can cause skin irritation, headaches, and fatigue, and can be especially dangerous for individuals with underlying conditions like allergies or respiratory problems. this is a gymnasium in decline, but it is no good blaming gym personnel. start taking the health and safety of your customers seriously. disturbingly shocking!"

5,2023-11-17,Wonderful motivated staff,"wonderful motivated staff, who are dedicated to their role and welfare of all members!! a big shout out to daria and josh who have done back to back classes this week!! however, there has been a few issues with the gym, which i have already raised with the management at stratford and head office (which have been dealt with professional by all). unfortunately, a number of clients abuse the gym (break machines/hand dryers/soap dispensers/leave their litter wherever etc). i try to help out as best i can."
1,2023-11-18,Not a good start,"not a great start at all, joined and booked an induction but the person who was suppose to do it was a no show with no contact at all. which is rich seen as there is a 3 strike rule for classes. also the app says the induction was done which is a lie.  it was only my second visit but i had to do a 44min round trip as i wouldn’t normally be in the area on a saturday.  other than that first impressions are the equipment is pretty old and grubby. the cleaning station isn’t well stocked and there is only one which from my observations means most people don’t bother.  edit: i dont see why i should have to go out of my way to contact the gym manager and to be honest wouldnt know how. i am sure if you feedback the date of my experiance he should very easily be able to check.  pretty unhelpful reply to the review actually you should be much more proactive."

5,2023-11-13,Best staff and experience,"hiya all. i regularly travel the length and breadth of the uk and consequently have visited a vast array of gyms in both sectors. pure gym has been, for numerous years,  my reserve.. always available and a plethora of gyms nationwide. though they are extremely convenient i have never seen fit to praise, that is until i visited dumfries. not a huge selection of equipment though more than enough. what does stand out head and shoulders is both the staff, who are all, bar one, cheerful, professional, helpful, attentive  and better than most all pure gym employees. i would especially recommend evgenia baillie. three of the staff addressed me by name, so impressed, no other gym has managed to address me personally, none other than my regulars. the gym is the tidiest public gym that i have been too, including the bathrooms, exceptionally so. i spoke to one of the cleaners, very hardworking and conscientious lady happy work and chat. the free classes are well considered and not overwhelming, suitable for all. though i think that it is difficult to complete a choice of similar classes throughout the week. the fine folk of dumfries were a friendly crowd too.  i was only here/there for one week but hopefully i will return. kevinjon 😁"

4,2023-11-14,Go to the classes with the best instructors!,"good cheap gym. some of the instructors in the class are fantastic (sue is full of energy and makes you feel great), some make it obvious they make the class up as they go along which makes you feel like they don’t want to be in that class teaching it so you feel that you don’t want to come back to their class. also would prefer the classes that got reduced to go back to 45 minutes"
5,2023-11-17,PureGym in Charlon is an excellent gym,"puregym in charlon is an excellent gym, with good facilities, great fitness classes and friendly staff. the membership is very reasonable and allows you to attend the gym without breaking the bank.  the manager, ella, is outstanding and has done an amazing job of running the charlton branch. ella listens to customers needs and responds. her classes are also fantastic.  puregym in charlon is located within a small retail park, which offers free parking for four hours. there is also a sainsburys and m&s next to the gym, aldi, asda, and another retail park is nearby.  im able to attend the gym after completing the school run and also do my weekly shop.  this is why i favour charlton over other locations."

5,2023-11-01,Gemma Thomas PT Great!  Also very happy with the gym,"i recently finished 4 pt sessions with gemma thomas and i had a great experience! before the sessions, i didnt really know what i was doing, i avoided using certain machines or venturing into the weights area. gemma and i discussed my training goals and in my first session we did a general ""lets see where youre at"" in a range of exercises to understand my strengths, areas for improvement, etc. ive finished my sessions with a clear idea of what exercises i can do to work certain muscle groups and what weights work for me. she sent everything over to me in a text and i have it all written in my phone now for quick access when im there. gemma is also super lovely and encouraging.  if i wasnt on a crazy budget before travelling soon, id have continued my sessions, having someone there to motivate you and push you makes such a difference. its also really affordable and value for money.  the gym itself is very good, its got a wide variety of machines and areas to work out. i find mondays are very busy, so prepare yourself! but everyone is friendly and willing to offer advice if you ever want it.  2 hr free parking validation is a bonus too!"
4,2023-11-15,Could do with warmer showers and wipes for equipment.,could do with warmer showers and wipes for equipment in giffnock.
3,2023-11-15,It's a budget gym,"its a budget gym, you get what you pay for. i joined again recently and it is far worse than it was in 2016.  compared to other gyms at a similar price, the gym is lacking cable machines and also accessories for the cable machines. an addition of a box next to the cables to store accessories would be great, similar to how jd gyms store their accessories.  secondly being a budget gym, people disrespect the equipment inside so much more, the free weights are all over the place and more should be done to penalise members not returning weights, or staff should do more to return the weights to where they should be.  finally the male showers are poor, there is always a foul stench in the far left and middle showers, seems something with drainage. also, the lockers, many have doors missing, or the are bent, and the hair dryers, the left needs to be replaced as it over heats within a minute of use.  final thoughts, there is a lot to improve, but you get what you pay for. maybe it is better to spend a couple of £ more and go to a different gym"
3,2023-11-10,start controlling what is happening at the gym,"no one keeps track of the age of children using the gym.  after all, there is always a promotion🤦‍♀️ a regular customer cannot attend the workaut because the machines are blocked by children who are on their phones.  they exercise incorrectly, they injure themselves, and none of the employees react to it."
3,2023-11-16,The new cardio set up on the second…,the new cardio set up on the second floor is bad . this is because now there’s at least 6 cardio machines that face directly towards the leg machines at close proximity . this makes it uncomfortable when doing leg workouts as you’ll have 3-6 people facing and looking at you .
5,2023-11-16,5 Star PT Chantelle,"started off with the classes at the end of covid and after a few months i wanted more of a challenge so i started training with pt chantelle. chantelle is the queen of leg day but she absolutely knows her stuff when it comes to upper body too! i started off wanting to lose weight and since achieving that its all about strength! i have made such incredible progress and i couldnt have done it without chantelles knowledge and guidance. i feel so much more confident in the gym and in ""real life""! thank you chantelle!"
1,2023-11-16,I only come here because of the lack of competition,"£30 - thats how much my membership costs per month. the equipment is old, tired, squeaky & rusty. when something breaks, it takes weeks to be repaired & because theres just 1 of everything, more often than not you are left waiting for someone to finish. how foolish of me to assume when you made a huge deal about ""were building you a better gym""& ""upgrading your gym to bring a brand-new look and feel and the latest kit"", that this would mean new equipment replacing old & a total refresh. nope, youve just gotten rid of some cardio equipment (keeping the various out of service treadmills in place) and adding a functional area in the cleared space. weight machines are now uncomfortably squeezed together - fantastic! the air con is patchy at best. its an oven in the summer and freezing in winter. the showers are tepid and in desperate need of upgrading. this morning, without any prior warning via social media or emails to members, the gents showers were closed for re-grouting - surely this has been planned for weeks, why couldnt you send a very simple email to advise the showers would be unavailable?! the only reason this gym is as busy as it is, is because theres no competition in the area. expect your memberships to plummet when snap fitness opens, because people will realise there are better alternatives."
4,2023-11-16,Basic but value for money,"the gym is quite basic and some of the equipment is out of order some of the time. but it’s a budget gym, so i think that some of the negative reviews on here are unfair, and the expectations of some people are unrealistic. if you choose to go at peak times, it’s obviously going to be busy! the cleaner and other staff members are busy every morning hoovering, wiping down the equipment, and cleaning the changing rooms. sam, the gym manager, is an absolute delight. she’s always smiling, and very friendly and approachable, so it’s a real shame that she’s moving on."

5,2023-11-12,Jake has made me love the gym already!,i was really nervous about starting at a new gym. i have adhd and autism and its very difficult for me to connect with people and (often) figure out how to use/ do things in the gym. i just had my getting started and learn to lift session with jake and i had absolutely no reason to be worried. he made such an effort to connect with me and couldnt do enough to make sure i was comfortable. ive honestly never had so much fun in the gym as i did in this hour and a bit with jake. pts can be so intimidating but he was a welcome breath of fresh air. i cant wait to book onto one of his classes and im so pleased that ive left my first session at pure gym radiating jake style positivity instead of feeling too scared to come back. thank you so much jake!
1,2023-11-11,Obvious discrimination,"my housemate (f) and i (m) are looking for a gym together (for the classes). looking to trial a few classes.  we both wrote to member services asking for a trial. she was offered a free 3 day pass. i was told they don’t do trials and to purchase a membership.  i wrote back with a screenshot of the divergent responses and was told that the difference in treatment is because she either is or was a member, and i was not.  my housemate has in fact never been a member of puregym, she is only joining because i am. i have been a member for years so i pointed out my membership details and the same ‘membership’ based trial is now not on the table for myself.  now the only apparent differences between myself and my housemate is that i am male with an asian name, while she is female and not of an asian background.  as everything else is equal. i can only conclude puregym members’ services, in my case, are discriminating on the basis of either race and/or gender.  now puregym will come back with the obvious ‘we treat everyone equally’ but as with everything in life, actions speak louder than words."

1,2023-11-08,"disgusting, misogynistic class","my friend and i have just had the most disgraceful experience at the canary wharf gym. we booked onto the learn to lift session with what they call on their website “a fitness coach”. the app told us to wait in the functional area, so we arrived there 10 minutes early.  at 18:05 - 5 minutes after the 30 minute class was meant to start, he saunters over and starts to go into the men’s changing room. another pt we spoke to earlier called him over and he looked at us and asked what we wanted. we explained we were there for his class. he then proceeds to look at us like a piece of dirt, and passively aggressively explain he’s been waiting by the tables at the entrance. we explain the app told us to wait at the functional area and he proceeds to say “no, you need to wait at the tables you know what tables are, i was there that’s where you need to go”. his attitude and attempts to mansplain what a table was absolutely disgusting. he then goes to walk away and we asked whether he was taking the session. he said he would come back later.  this experience felt incredibly misogynistic and as two female gym goers has knocked our confidence in ever coming back to puregym if this is how women are treated. his attitude towards the very fact we weren’t waiting for him where he was, whilst we were in the right area, was disgusting. we’ve cancelled our memberships as we don’t feel comfortable around him in the future.  the gym has asked me to remove his personal details so unfortunately other women gym goers can’t be warned about him. would be good to hear back from the manager on this incident but alas we’re still waiting.  edit: have seen the reply. the same reply i received on google and twitter. i got in touch with the manager previous to writing this review, still no response …"

1,2023-11-07,Terrible first visit not sure I’m returning,"today was my first day and really let down. recently started working in coventry but home is sutton coldfield. was going for the off peak membership as i wanted to do 6.30am classes before work but as i wanted both gyms had to pay the higher membership, which is fine. i got up at 5am today, got ready, drove to coventry to do the class i was booked onto. i was then told that as i was the only one booked on he cancelled the class!!! i asked if they had sent an email or message telling people and he just said no we don’t do that. i said i’d got up at 5am to get there and he just said ‘oh right’ and walked round pointing machines out to me. not exactly sure how that is acceptable as he is paid to be there and i’m paying to do the class. whether it is one person or twenty the class should be taught. so now im left having paid for this and not getting what i’ve paid for. i only joined for the 6.30 classes as it’s the only time i have but am i now expected to turn up at 6.30am n hope that i might actually get what i’ve paid for? really, really disappointed. it’s taken me so much to get in the right headspace to get back to the gym n having to work around my diary and split time between birmingham and coventry and getting up super early to do so, only to be let down. very bad service and not sure i’m going to go back. sad really. only expect the guy to do his job and what i’m paying for.  9/11/23 with regards to your response, yet again i’m am being shown the lack of interest in customer service or satisfaction. instead i’m being told to contact other people and (as you mention in your reply) it would be easier to include all my information. all the information is in the original review/email! i told u which gyms, what days, what time and you have my name! seriously how difficult can it be. this place is just making me more and more angry. stay away from puregym - you can see from start to finish the way things have been and how they’ve been dealt with. dont waste your time and money!!"

5,2023-11-06,Amasing Spin Classes,"paul, spin on a monday morning and tuesday evening are amasing. so incredibly kind and welcoming. paul took the time to answer my questions at the end of the class and offered to give targeted advice now im back at the gym following giving birth to my first baby. i would definitely recommend, amasing classes and amazing pt. challenging and rewarding classes. super friendly. thank you."
5,2023-11-06,Great gym,"great gym. good, quality equipment. well spaced out and well maintained. staff are always friendly and helpful."
5,2023-11-06,It keeps me going,"look, i am 84 years old. i have given up pretending to be 20 and thoroughly enjoy just trogging along on my usual round of exercises. there are nice people to chat to. now i have a shower at home (disabled wife), i have my shower on my return. i like the gym"
1,2023-11-06,Not amazing,"overcrowded gym where the biggest free area of the gym is always closed off for classes, exasperating the issue. ceiling is always leaking; they never turn the air con on in the warmer months; and the staff aimlessly walk around sporadically enforcing gym rules you have never heard of in 4 years of being a pure gym member.  unfortunately, have only found these issues with this specific gym having attended ones in nottingham, manchester and london which have always been pleasant. however, i have decided to moved to a different gym after the needed final push today, thank you."
5,2023-11-06,Boxing with Robbie Butler,"i’ve been doing regular boxing with robbie since june. the sessions have been really fun and it’s rewarding to see the progress i’ve made with the moves. working with robbie has really helped me keep in shape, improve my cardio fitness and kept me motivated with my overall fitness routine. the sessions are a good mix of cardio and core work, with changes/options for the session which keeps it interesting.   robbie is encouraging without being pushy which gets the most of each session. he’s friendly, brings energy, and has a sense of humour, which is a bonus! i’ve really enjoyed working with robbie and would throughly recommend!"
5,2023-11-05,Outstanding experience for a reasonable price,"clean gym, large number of equipments, open 24/7, reasonable membership fees, very friendly and approachable staff, outstanding classes with amazing coaches, mainly will, adam, and vanessa, honestly speaking their classes are very well prepared, suites all training levels, with amazing positive atmosphere to bring the best out of everyone attending. nathan as well has been my pt for the past few weeks and i can’t praise him enough, his gym classes or the pt sessions are absolutely amazing!!! i’ve tried puregym in other cities before, this one is by far my favourite!"

5,2023-11-04,Good service,good service. thanks
3,2023-10-19,Decent but issues with accessibility,"i’ve been going to the gym in general for a few years but have been going to this gym for about a month, the staff are really friendly and helpful and there’s a great range of equipment. however the classes are so unnecessarily loud with a lot of shouting and can be heard from every part of the gym! this makes the gym a lot less accessible for members with sensory processing disorders such as autism and adhd because it becomes very overwhelming and can trigger anxiety especially with the shouting, and the super loud volume is just annoying and distracting in general, even with headphones on"
4,2023-11-04,Excellent for general use fair for pro athletes,limited variety of equipment was the only problem for me as a pro athlete i expected to have a vast number of different machines and equipments
1,2023-11-04,Saturday at wrexham puregym..,"saturday at wrexham puregym... no music, cold showers and constantly being reminded that you are in a safe place and you wont be harrased. 🤔 ive been using gyms for years, always safe and no harrasment. i wont be using puregym again."
3,2023-11-01,"Feedback on Pure Gym at Greenwich, London, SE10","first and foremost, i appreciate the positive atmosphere and environment at the gym. its a welcoming place for fitness enthusiasts like myself.  however, there are a couple of aspects where i believe there is room for improvement: shower facilities: the water temperature in the shower facilities has been somewhat inconsistent. it would be beneficial if the water temperature could be more conducive for a comfortable post-workout shower. this is an essential part of the gym experience, and adjustments to improve it would be greatly appreciated.  wifi connectivity: ive noticed that the gyms wifi is often unreliable, making it challenging to stay connected or access online resources while at the gym. a more stable and reliable wifi connection would greatly enhance the overall experience, especially for those who use fitness apps or prefer to stream workouts.  i believe that addressing these two issues would significantly contribute to an even better gym experience for all members. i understand that improvements might take time, but it would be wonderful to receive updates on any plans to address these concerns."
5,2023-11-04,Excellent class with excellent…,excellent class with excellent instruction from chris. showers and changing rooms are clean.
1,2023-11-04,It's far too hot,"its too hot. i appreciate the outside temperature is dropping but the temperature in the gym is far too high. if the gym is a bit cold, well you soon warm up when you start working out. but its so hot that im sweating before i even start. it is hotter than i have my living room at home. if it doesnt change im going to have to find another gym as its intolerable at the moment. also, i cant help but think it would save puregym money to turn the heat down."

4,2023-11-03,Pleasant wee work out,not too busy and no waiting around. size of the shower cubicles still bug me though!!
1,2023-11-03,worst hygiene in recorded history,"the worst hygiene of any gym i have ever seen. there are reviews going back several years saying how disgusting the place is and yet they do nothing. all other puregyms have sanitizer, hand towels. this place doesnt even have soap in the toilets or a working hand dryer. staff tell you to bring your own sanitizer!! disgraceful. i usually go to oval but weekends stuck with this sh@t hole.  and they always put the same meaningless, generic response - see below. pathetic"
1,2023-11-03,Very nasty gym!,"very nasty gym! the staffs are so unprofessional, uncivilised,jealous and racists toward people of colour. ive seen many white folks workout with bare foot and nobody ever told them nothing but when i did,it was a problem. go back to school you mf uneducated poor things! would you worked out with alexander mcqueens shoes if you had one?! you guys are same as police officers, whenever they see a black person drives a good and expensive car its a game!   so your policies have to be followed by certain groups of people only,innit?! strange!  listen yeah! i said what i have said due to my experience! i have things to do in ma life either mr/madam! and working out is one among them!  my time is golden to just go gym and start arguments with strangers! huh!! im not that kind of person at all! im the one who was been picked on and harassed by your staff at d first place. we all know exactly that people like you, always look for a chance to act accordingly plus im not even your gym member anymore! there are plenty of nice gyms out there for me rather than being in yours that makes feel attacked,disrespected and harassed... i literally do not tolerate disrespect and embarrassment! i take that sh** seriously either!  it was only my second week since i joined. but because of the worst experience, i immediately removed my fat ass out of it and not interested at all love!!ngl its the nastiest gym in derby!"
5,2023-11-01,Rochdale puregym Great PT Charlotte Mangan,"after training on and off over the last few years then hurting my shoulder, i decided it was time to work with a professional. i aimed to rebuild my confidence, strength and correct my form so i started looking at the personal trainers at pure gym. i joined in on a few fitness classes with different personal trainers to see how they worked and motivated the class. charlotte was great, not only did she motivate the class but she noticed my weaknesses and pushed me harder. ive been having pt sessions once a week with charlotte for a few months now and im really pleased to see how much my body has changed for the better. im getting stronger and fitter at the same time and have dropped a few inches off my waist. if im ever unsure about an exercise its very easy to speak to charlotte and she always makes training a good laugh and enjoyable, while keeping an eye on my form and pushing me to do that extra rep or two. i would highly recommend charlotte mangan to anyone"
5,2023-11-03,"Puregym, Sutton Times Square",a clean gym with a good range of equipment. good value.
5,2023-11-03,Personal Trainer - Charlotte,"this is more of a personal review aimed at a personal trainer rather than the actual gym, but i can’t recommend charlotte enough! literally goes above and beyond to make each one of us feel comfortable and confident in the gym. shes doesn’t only help us in the gym but arranges get togethers outside of the gym. she’s always there to message if you need motivation, advice or inspiration with workouts or food. i get a specific workout plan set for me every couple of months based on what my goals are whether it’s weight loss or toning up!  she’s really helped boost my confidence in the gym and i genuinely can’t thank her enough!!"
5,2023-11-03,Fantastic Gym,"fantastic gym, brilliant staff and exercise classes."
1,2023-11-03,PureGym Burnham,"without doubt the worst gym i have ever visited. it’s dirty, outdated, the men’s locker rooms permanently smell of human waste and bo. absolutely disgusting. the members seem to have all joined from the local primary school, no gym etiquette at all. every visit is stressful, particularly since there is an epidemic of car break ins at the gym car park. there is even a sign on the door stating this. disgusting place on every level."

1,2023-10-17,Saucy staff,"morning gym routine made awkward by the constant interactions between a male pt and his girlfriend (customer), and a female pt and her boyfriend (customer). sick of looking at this early every morning - a complete lack of professionalism.  save it for your free time and not when at work. i have signed up for a new gym starting next week."

4,2023-11-02,1 year in now,1 year in now! fantastic gym and amazing value for money! close to home so it’s very handy for me! also think it’s fantastic that you can use many other locations at no extra cost with the multi membership as allows me to train when i go away!  app also really helpful if you want workout inspiration or vids on how to use machines. only drawback is during busy periods i’m sometimes unable to complete my workout due to machines being in use.
2,2023-11-02,WiFi still useless …,since my review of the kentish town branch in april and puregym’s response that they would address the issue of poor wifi i have to report no improvement. marked down from 3 stars to 2 as a result.

3,2023-10-29,puregym get your music sorted,"has a decent amount of equipment, could do with more machines that use plates as weight, however, get rid of the trash music playing out the speakers, the songs are bogging and the majority of people just listen to their own music anyways, but they can barely listen to their own music unless theyve got noise cancelling headphones because the speakers are blaring the most horrid music ive ever heard. get the music off puregym"
2,2023-11-02,I have attended this gym for three…,"i have attended this gym for three years, but nothing has changed. the machines are dirty, and the lockers cannot be closed because the doors are bent. it seems like other gyms are no different. the machines are often broken, and it takes ages for them to be repaired. its disgusting, but i should not expect much from puregym. it seems like they dont care much about their customers. or maybe? cleaners management? its wrong? they are unable to handle everything i know in advance its good in the gym, but they have to look on the other hand as well...."
5,2023-11-02,It a great PureGym to come to,it a great puregym to come to. would love to see a hack squat at park royal. having that would seal the deal. that’s what missing.  overall it’s a great gym. also the new style lat pull down attachments. one more thing total gym abs

4,2023-11-01,Massive gym,"massive gym, great equipment, well located. the only negative spot is that men’s changing room always smells disgusting. it’s something that needs to be improved."
4,2023-10-31,Excellent- but what about a Hack Squat Machine?,"the facilities and the staff are exceptional, friendly and knowledgeable. my only complaint (and reason for giving an 8) is there is no hack squat machine. this is a must for any gym and an expectation of the members"

4,2023-10-14,Cost competitive gym,"cost competitive gym. price of gym is very good, especially with vitality discount. equipment is relatively solid and staff are amazingly friendly. also seems a good social side on the classes too. could be improved with spin bikes/ class and also battle bikes/ tractor tyres for strength / weight loss gains."
4,2023-11-01,Hope you like Avicii at 250 dB,"ive taken out an off-peak membership for the winter months, purely to use the treadmills so my marathon training doesnt take a hit.  i cant complain about the machines, they more than do the job. the times i visit are quiet enough with lots of space.  the only downside is the music volume in the classes. if i cant hear anything from a headphone that is millimeters from my eardrum - then maybe your music is too loud? doesnt help that the music is atrocious but thats neither here nor there.  god help those who regularly use the classes - fitness with a side of tinnitus?  a few of the lockers are in need of maintenance, locks do not close properly because the frame of the locker has been bent and damaged."
2,2023-10-05,Terrible customer service,the actual gym was fine but the customer service (or basically total lack of customer service) was unbelievably irritating. i a few times had issues with things that didnt work properly on the app like class booking errors and when i tried to contact anyone it was impossible. there is no phone line and when i emailed or sent a facebook message i got taken through a massive loop of replies from bots and then when i got through to a person they didnt seem to have all the information id already sent and then each reply was from a new person who also didnt seem to understand the the previous conversation. i got very general copy and paste replies that didnt have any relevance to my questions when i had issues or questions about the gym. the final straw was that when i tried to cancel it was impossible on the website and app as the instructions for how to cancel just took me in a loop and it had a very scammy feel. the instructions for how far in advance you need to cancel are also very different in different parts of the app and website.

5,2023-11-01,Amazing gym and facilities. Highly Recommend this gym,"the gym is absolutely amazing and all the personal trainers at pure gym park royal are always willing to help anyone and they make my day better.  the gym is very big, has many machines and the staff help to always keep it clean. i would highly recommend this gym!!"
2,2023-10-30,"No staff around, equipment not cleaned","the equipment seems to no longer be cleaned and wiped down by actual cleaning staff. i used to see staff and cleaning staff around before covid but now theyre nowhere to be seen. now i see lumps of dust sitting on all the treadmills and the changing room looking shabby. i think they have the mentality of expecting members to do the cleaning themselves, and if the members arent going to do it then tough, so be it. really disappointing as the standards were very good before. i used to love that they kept it clean and offered a ladies only section but it feels icky to work out there now."
2,2023-10-30,"Maggots, flooding, mould","unfortunately i was left no choice but to leave a bad review!  over the weekend there was flooding, toilets was out of service and the showers wasnt working. i understand things can sometimes go wrong but we should have got an email about this or have access to other gyms!  a few days later i noticed they fixed the problem but i see mould and maggots on the side of the shower!  i tried to email them directly about it but i got no response. very unhygienic!  i really hope that start taking this seriously because this is quite serious!"
3,2023-10-18,Not impressed,"recently joined this gym after leaving jd round the corner..i have to say im disappointed… ive worked in gyms over the years. the gym its self is spacious and cool air con works..i dont use changing facilitys so cant comment on this….there is a lack of equipment especially stack machines which are located upstairs, the staff although friendly seem to gather round a bar type seating area in the middle of the gym…there gym bags, water bottles food, are all there, they seem to be laughing, at one point playing paper aeroplanes, i find this very unprofessional and intimidating, of all the gyms i have worked in and worked out of i have never seen this happen, do they not have a staff room to do this in, it really puts me off going to the point of returning back to jd, pure gym you could do better."

1,2023-10-28,No improvements for years and years,"no improvements for years and years some equipment either dont work or have missing parts to it the staff turnover is regular, so our membership fees do get used partially, but the equipment at the gym never gets maintained or fixed"
5,2023-10-31,I had an induction Ella was lovely and…,i had an induction ella was lovely and explained everything really well she understood my needs as i have balance issues but was very patient and understanding this is going to be a long journey but one i am looking forward to.
3,2023-10-30,Overall a good gym environment,overall a good gym environment. as a regular gym goer seeing a few pieces of equipment out of use for long periods of time is not very helpful when you want to use that machine. one of the adjustable benches needs a refresh and one of the cable machines has been out of use for sometime. i question whether the £35 a month is worth it.
2,2023-10-27,Terrible gym.,"terrible gym. visited 3 different sites in the south london area. various machines out of service , no air con on so the whole gym is like a sweat box and on one location, the front door was off the hinges and da homeless person sleeping in the entrance hall. the price you pay is not worth the service it offers."
1,2023-10-31,Joined Pure Gym Solihull (Sears Park)…,"joined pure gym solihull (sears park) last week. visited this morning at 6am and no members of staff were there to open up. waited 20 minutes in the rain and then went home.  whilst in queue, i spoke to a group of people who told me the gym not opening on time is not uncommon.  i would avoid this gym as it’s amateurish and badly run. i plan on cancelling my membership."
5,2023-10-30,Flexible and straight forward.,i just need a gym temporarily while were in the wet and cold season. so for me a flexible arrangement i can cancel when i choose is imperative. this is my 1st restatement of my membership with this gym. the prices are good too.
1,2023-10-23,Freezing cold changing room and shower,"the issue i am referring to pertains to the unreasonably cold temperature in the shower rooms designated for women. it appears that the air conditioning is continuously left on, resulting in an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience for gym members. the excessive coldness makes it challenging to have a refreshing and satisfactory shower, subsequently impacting our overall gym experience.  what concerns me the most is the dismissive attitude displayed by the staff when i have voiced my complaint. instead of actively addressing the issue, they have merely laughed and nodded in agreement, which is deeply disheartening. as a loyal and dedicated customer of pure gym, i believe that our concerns should be treated with utmost importance and professionalism.i kindly request that pure gym take immediate action to rectify this situation. it is essential that the air conditioning in the shower rooms is adjusted to ensure a comfortable environment for gym members. additionally, i urge pure gym to address the attitude of the staff towards customer complaints, emphasizing the importance of providing a supportive and respectful environment."

1,2023-10-30,Been a member of pure gym for a little…,"been a member of pure gym for a little while now and found it exactly what i want apart from the lack of cleanliness which they are now addressing . however over the weekend they have turned the water temperature down and  showers are now very unpleasant. i use the gym before work and it’s essential the gym i use provides shower facilities.  i now feel i have to change gyms as cold showers are not what i signed up for .  very disappointing.would appreciate pure gym replying to this review, as they have a 5 star positive review further down this list of reviews!"
2,2023-10-25,Unclean and Parking Robbers,been a member of this gym for the past year and the experience has been okay its busy at peak times (as to be expected) great early in the mornings but not many cleaning stations nor kept clean in the changing rooms and worst of all i got multiple parking finesfor using the gym that i already pay for and puregym holds no accountability for doing business with the horrible gansters over at euro car parks...
5,2023-10-30,The gym is very clean,the gym felt airy and clean when i visited today and karis always has smile
1,2023-10-10,Parking fine,"nice gym, but parking is a scam. been member for 6 years at orpington, but used crayford as one off whilst refurbishment being carried out. was not aware you needed to put in registration number to use the members car park. got fined for 100 quid. pure gym wont help. the only thing left to do is let people know they down care about members who theyve had for 6 years. will be cancelling my membership.  update 07/11/2023. resonse for pure gym below is standard cut and paste. they send this reply on all formats. going to the gym should be an enjoyable, relaxing experience. if you are going to a new gym in your lunch hour and anything like me, you are rushing and dont have time to look at tiny wording on small signs or an ipdad in the gym to put your car details in. sorry pure gym, you did nothing to intervene. just standard responses like below just like all the other cases where members have be fined and you did nothing. how any gym can allow members especially long term ones like me to get fined for a having a workout is beyond me. but all i can do is cancel my membership as you clearly dont care about members."

2,2023-10-28,It was my first visit to this club,it was my first visit to this club. i came on a scooter and i left it in the male locker room on saturday evening. as i returned to the locker room to collect the scooter at 11 pm after my workout the scooter went missing.  there was nobody around to report about the event. i sent emails over the weekend but nobody returned them. the phones did not respond.  on monday i reported a crime to the police. the police assigned a crime ref. number and i sent this number to the emails provided on the site. it was at this point only when somebody finally contacted me by phone.  the manager said the club can do nothing to help me other than wait until the police does something. i was not offered any apologies or a refund.  the place looks more like a ghost house full of criminals than a sports club. i regret i paid that visit.  leonid

1,2023-10-30,"PT - unprofessional, bullying and defensive text in response to feedback","the pt i complained about and provided with feedback has contacted me directly with a long defensive and aggressive text message - distorting the truth to cover his own back. his text was made up of calling me names and distorted scenarios to protect himself - scenarios he has never mentioned until ive raised this complaint. the fact these scenarios were never documented or raised shows that this is a false narrative being used to protect himself.  this shows the inability to receive feedback and respond professionally. the professional and correct response wouldve been to apologise, raise it with his line manager or address the refund.  i have contacted the cluster manager again with a screenshot of his text messages. along with the truth about these false allegations hes using to justify his unjust behaviour.  i hope puregym deal with this unprofessionalism and bullying appropriately. i advise all members receive professional training on customer service, and diversity & inclusion (which covers discrimination and gender equality). i feel as though a lot of this was driven by x (pt) perceiving me as a young black woman he could take advantage of, and did not expect i would escalate appropriately.  i will continue to feedback any negative experiences from x or the general gym staff here and escalate to the regional manager - no paying customer should be treated this way, and i hope this doesnt happen again."

1,2023-10-07,No interest or help from staff member.?,"email sent twice to customer services and still waiting for response, nearly 4 weeks later ??? .......  dear sir/madam,  ive recently joined the puregym at westwood gateway retail park in broadstairs, kent on 2nd october. having not been to a gym for quite some time, i was both happy and excited to see that you offer a ""get started "" induction class, to help and demonstrate the facilities and safety at the branch. i booked this straight away for this weekend as i wanted to feel more confident when using the gym equipment. my booking information was confirmed in the week (please find attached)  i arrived approx 10 mins early but unfortunately, my pass code would not work for entrance to the gym. i managed to get help from another member who let me in and i was going to bring it up with the (staff member) during the induction.  she wasnt at the entrance as stated, so i took a seat on the nearby benches. about 3:10pm, nobody had arrived, despite saying there was only 2 spaces left on my booking. i gave it till about 3:20pm and went upstairs on the mezzanine, which i thought there maybe a staff member, but the offices were all shut. i rechecked my emails and it was definitely the right time/date.  i looked over to the corner of the gym and saw a lady with what looked like a puregym uniform on. i approached her and apologized for interrupting and asked her about the class. she replied with that she was (staff member) and the class should not of been booked as she doesnt work saturdays? she kept blaming the management for the mistake? i asked her what can i do, as id taken the afternoon off work to attend the class and she said you can try and book again for next weekend, but itll be no good as nobody works here at weekends??  i found her very strange and unhelpful as she was actually there working, despite saying she doesnt work on saturdays??  i left the gym feeling quite deflated and confused about the whole situation and lack of empathy from (staff member).  for this reason, i really would appreciate for you to arrange a refund on my opening account fund as i dont think i want to carry on with being a member of puregym. ive enclosed my receipt email for that too. please advise.  yours sincerely, sl  ive obviously not enclosed the staff members name as advised by trust pilot, but really disappointed about the whole situation and the fact the staff member was not interested in helping me in any way (ie) informing the gym manager or advising me of what to do ?"
5,2023-10-28,Kassidy is a real professional,"i’ve been attending the gym at borough for almost 6 months and have been truly impressed with kassidy chaplin.  the way he conducts training sessions are very well thought through, he’s always 100% present and makes sure the form is correct, be it 1-2-1 sessions or group ones. he really stands out as someone who’s not only in great shape himself but is also a great teacher. apart from that, kassidy has a caring personality, is great fun to be around and makes me literally run to the gym to be part of his classes!"

4,2023-10-26,Good,lots of people looovveee ahfreens thursdays 18:30pm burn it class in hoxton. pure gym hoxton needs to do more circuit style classes in the evenings. ahfreen and vincents was the best . please put ahfreen aktar on more evening and weekend classes because her classes are the best. however all her classes are the morning very early which no one can attend.  also vincent metcon class is very good however the times are random time during the day. please make some of them evening. vincent is also a great instructor.  robbies burn it classes are also very good.  one negative: encourage members to clean equipment after using esp after classes because people sweat over the equipment and just put them straight back and its unhygienic. also more cleaning stations in the gym with actual wipes not the spray. so people are encouraged to maintain the cleanliness of the equipment.

1,2023-10-26,They lie about parking,"they lie about parking, they say 7/24 free onsite parking. but after 12.01 am parking control fine you automatically. and pure gym does not help at all to remove this fine. i paid £170 to the parking fine 2 times, £350 in total. before paying these, 3 times i went to pure gym, told that i am a member, 1 time called the solicitors, mailed to uk parking control. no one did anything, they just forced me to pay the fine."
5,2023-10-25,Exceptional PT,"ive an outstanding personal trainer, ray, which is why ive been a member of puregym kentish town since it opened in 2016.  rays got my fitness level to the highest ever, taught me to maintain a healthy diet and kept me on track to reach my target weight. rays motivated me so that going to puregym and focusing on my fitness and health are now very much my way of life. had a great session yesterday having just got back from holiday. hghly recommend ray."

3,2023-10-26,Health and safety problems,i sometimes do spin classes in the morning with no issues. this is my second spin class that ive attended at lunch time and on both occasions the cleaner has saw fit to mop the floor just before the class starts causing a breach of health and safety. the manager apologised last week and assured us that it wouldnt happen again and yet here we are again!!!!! not happy!!

5,2023-10-15,Perfect for early birds,"ive been a regular at this gym for quite some time now, and i can confidently say its my go-to spot for a morning workout. the fact that theyre open 24 hours is a huge plus for someone like me who prefers avoiding the crowds. the gym maintains a clean and tidy environment, which is always a welcome sight, and theres no shortage of equipment to choose from. so far, ive encountered no issues or inconveniences. its the perfect place for those early risers looking for a hassle-free fitness experience."

4,2023-10-15,Way too hot!!!,"way too hot!!! they put the heating on in the cardio area when its 17 degrees. people are hot and sweaty working out... we dont need air conditioning blasting hot air at us. my husband feels the same way and ive heard others say the same.  also, cleaning is very poor, i never see cleaners actually cleaning machines or weights. one treadmill has the same piece of food and tissue stuck in the drink holder for weeks. one guy working here walked up to one single window panel and rubbed the glass with a dripping wet mop and walked off.. i dont think they know how to clean properly.  good equipment but its not clean. i moved nearest to this gym, my old gym had a ladies only section which i liked. i feel like after 6pm this gym is full of young lads hogging all the weights so im not confident to use that section when its busy, but thats just my feeling and the gym is not in control of those situations.  i want to do my cardio without sweating before ive even started."
3,2023-10-24,From the couple of times i have been…,"redditch…from the couple of times i have been, the gym is as i expect from a commercial gym, the cardio section though is the most uninspiring section i have seen in any gym. 90% of machines facing a wall, i don’t expect much but even mirrors so i can see my bloated red face would be better, don’t understand how that was deemed the best lay out??"
4,2023-10-15,The gym is what someone would expect…,"the gym is what someone would expect from a pure gym type of gym. it has most of the necessary equipment and it is clean enough. two things that are worth noting are that for some unknown reason the studio is constantly locked when not running a class. this may be a small thing for some but as a woman i would rather prefer to use that space in order to do some of my exercises in peace and comfortably. all the gyms i experienced before (even ones with way worse services and lower prices) keep the studio open so that people can use to feel more comfortable either because the gym could be busy or just because they want to avoid being stared by other members. last, there are quite a few corners into the gym (especially most of the lower floor) that i have absolutely zero signal. i have checked with other people as well and it is not a personal issue. it may be a generalised area issue but it would be easily resolved with providing a simple wifi connection to the gym members.  the outcomes: the gym is in a pretty good state and its efficient enough. just leave the studio open like most gyms please. a wifi network would solve the signal issue in no minute."
1,2023-10-24,Air conditioner only blows HOT air!,"was ok during the summer now this gym have started to turn off cool air from the air conditioning and instead turn on hot air! in a gym! so when you are sweating you have hot air blowing in your face ! this is a health hazard. i’m surprised trading standards haven’t been called! sort it out! we want cool air , stop this hot air ! because of this i will be quitting my membership and will go elsewhere ."

1,2023-10-23,Not good,"*as per the email i sent to group and colne*  please can you register this as an official complaint.  can you please put in a request to turn the temperatures and water pressures back up in the showers at your gym.  i was disappointed when your group issued the order to turn them all down, and it was intolerable a few months ago when the weather was warm. now it is winter it is unbearable. you come out shivering, unclean and i’m sure will end up getting a cold/flu eventually.  it is so bad i am actually actively looking at moving gyms."

1,2023-10-24,Broken equipment never gets repaired…,"broken equipment never gets repaired have to wait months, ladies showers smell filthy always cold lots of members complied about how cold the showers are but got ignored..  showers are not 33oc no way!!! they are very cold the gym staff lies to you they are never going to fix the cold shower issue, will find an alternative gym. sick of the bull#### used and alternative pure gym in dudley and the showers were not cold so it goes to show the ones in tipton are freezing and they refused to turn them up!! staff at tipton waste of time!!!!!  update no response from gym they gym is cold you know the heating wont come on, and the showers are still cold saving money at our expense."
2,2023-10-15,got worse over time,"in two years of going to the gym its has got worse over time and not getting any better and im looking for a new gym to go too. they promise wifi never happened and never got it in two years. but yet the staff have no issues getting online with the gym wifi?! no proper climate control. the main air con has been broken for the last two years and instead of fixing they try using portable units that dont do the job so in summer its to hot and in winter the hot water temp is set to cold in the showers. the showers, sinks and drainage stinks and gets blocked all the time. so the drains need sorting or fixing. i now see more and more machines out of action and when there is only one of that machine it can be an issue to peoples routines. the flavour water dispenser seems to run out of flavour all the time or be out of order. there is damaged flooring stuck down with tape and silly stuff like that. so they charge you and make promises of things they dont deliver and the gym is literally falling apart and it seems the company or management dont care. so why should i pay a gym that dont give what they offer or take care of the gym and do repairs like they are meant to. so other than friendly staff and a lot of nice people that go even though a lot have stopped going. i dont see any reason to go to this gym."
1,2023-10-23,Unsatisfied,"i been coming here for a while, this gym is filthy, barley any cleaning supplies, hardly seen a cleaner. all the equipment all over the place. no health and safety care. machine are too close together waiting for an accident."

1,2023-10-15,APPALLING VOLUME OF RAVE MUSIC EARLY IN THE MORNING,"this is the third complaint i have written about the appalling volume of music in pure gym in salisbury. it is simply not acceptable.  i have spent over £200 on two sets of noise cancelling headphones in order to drown out the rave music being played at a high volume on a sunday morning! i was the only person in the gym at 4.30 am and it felt as though i was going to a rave!  after my second complaint i was shown where the volume control was and so i was able to turn the volume down myself, however this now seems to have been over ridden. may i respectfully ask why people want to listen to music at this level when most of them wear their own headphones anyway?  if there was another 24 hour gym in salisbury then i would immediately leave pure gym and join somewhere else.  i get up early to work out early for my own well-being before going to work. i run my own business and listen to my clients and find it appalling that pure gym do not take notice of negative feedback."

1,2023-10-23,Management terrible,"the facilities of the gym are ok, but they seem to not have any consideration of the customer. they choose to do deep cleaning of the locker rooms at 8:30 which is the time where people are rushing to get dressed and get out, no consideration that a girl cleaning male locker rooms at this time might not be ideal; last week they decided to move the equipment down the stairs- again at 8:45?! people queueing at the stairs to get out of the gym- in a 24 gym surely there is a better time to do this. this morning again 8:45 one pod out of order, the second pod was slow the manager woman as usual sat on her bottom, just shaking her head, no assistance offered. she could have got up and let people in or out through the disabled door but that would require getting up. the management is at fault here, but if you spend all day sitting there doing nothing what do you expect?"

1,2023-10-09,Poor show from pure gym,"poor show from pure gym. posted on social media 5 times a day for 8 weeks trying to get people through the door stating free parking at sainsbury’s and forgot to mention the caveat that you need to put your registration details in. no signage to state this just a small pad not easily on display if you aren’t looking for it and no communication via email. 12.99 a month sounds fantastic until it’s 85 quid to park. should have put a bit more focus on your social media/ communications in emails to let customers know, quite clearly reading the reviews and on facebook this is a communications issue from pure gym and quite frankly customers should be reinstated for your lack of communication"
1,2023-10-09,Just got first parking ticket,"just got first parking ticket , when signed up nothing was on website about entering details but now it’s on there! i understand it’s in the gym but my last pure gym was a machine to enter details if more than 2 hours you do not expect to park in a big car park advertised for pure hun and then have to enter car details if out of sainsbury’s hours so 1 £85 fine so far and been 6 times since , tried to contact to get details needed to appeal but no help , pure gym basically not their problem"
1,2023-10-14,Never going back!,i cancelled my gym membership on the app and through the bank however the company still went ahead and charged me a full amount for the next month and when i contacted them they said it was not cancelled and they would not give a refund back. looks like they have an ongoing app issue/bugs and they just take advantage. very disappointed by their response and customer service! there are better gyms out there

3,2023-10-14,No hot water for the showers for over a…,"no hot water for the showers for over a week. it took 6 weeks for a new aa battery to be replace in the clock in the change room -this now has been amend, but the cleaner had been told twice in the 6 weeks by me, not sure about other people, out of 4 hair dryers - 1 doesn’t work at all, 1 will start to work then cut out all together and you can’t start it until the hair is cold again, only for the same thing to happen again, 1 hair dryer works and i am yet to discover what the 4th one does, but not holding my breath. this has been amended but …… the male cleaner just walked into the female change room without calling out first before entering and no signs are out to let you know a male cleaner is in the female change room until your in the change room and see them. when complained about this, the response was, “oh well they don’t really speak english and don’t understand they have to let you know they are coming in”. no female staff on sight or if any, very little. on the positives the male head manager is very friendly and easy to approach and the complaints to him about the male cleaner and clock battery were amended straight away. it is always the usual complaints from staff, like in any big company - the small branches receive complaints all the time, the users are told they are passed onto head their managers who seemed to do bugger all, besides collecting their pay check. if you complain to head office they only pass you back to the manager of the small branch who tells you we have passed on your complaints to our managers and no point in complaining to head office as they don’t do anything. then you send out rating scores like this. what’s the point. maybe pay head office staff less money, employee english speaking or someone who can understand english for staff - if male staff can’t understand the simple basic manners of calling out as they enter the female change room, what hope in hell do females have if the cleaners come across an emergency - they can’t communicate on basic issues. maybe employee managers who can cut out the rubbish and get straight to the point and listen to branch managers who are passing on the information as there job tells them to. the branch manager is the reason why you go into this gym, he is really friendly and helpful. i do feel for him being in the position he is with the above complaints"
5,2023-10-20,Fantastic gym,mihaela’s classes on a friday at pure gym enfield are brilliant. she is always on hand to demonstrate and give advice. she pushes you to do your best and i always leave her classes feeling great. the stretch class is such a fantastic way to start the day especially after the bodytone class. the gym itself is full of very friendly down to earth people & i always feel comfortable there. a really good affordable gym that i would def recommend.
3,2023-10-19,"Air quality very humid ,as an asthma…","air quality very humid ,as an asthma sufferer i notice it immediately near the end of the treadmill area when a class is being taken .also walking through to the functional area ,air quality could be better as personal hygiene of some members isn’t taken into consideration..i know it’s a gym and people sweat but i know the difference between fresh sweat and stale body odour!"
1,2023-10-20,Puregym Academy,"firstly the gyms, the machines are rusty, dumbbells everywhere. in london, good luck getting a machine you need.  for some reason puregym academy is not on here, but its a scam. they dont tell you that on successful completion of the course, the job you get is paying them. its 12 hours a week plus giving them rent, which is deducted from pay. at the end of each month, this means you pay them £90. you have to work for free and make back a wage from your personal clients. this is not mentioning that the qualification is a joke and not going to look good against other pro pts, who of course mop up the clientelle.  once i found out this hidden information i tried to get even a partial refund (the course is 1600), and despite being only 2 weeks into the course, they say no refunds. absolute misrepresentation of everything.  scam artists, avoid at all costs."

4,2023-10-15,Gym is great/showers are cold/no bike rack,"gym is great, can’t fault the equipment. would be nice to have a small frame. changing rooms are small , only 3 showers and they don’t appear to be cleaned regularly , also the water temperature in the showers is not warm.only a few large lockers & majority are slim so i struggle getting a ruck sack in without pushing it in.still no cycle rack to lock bikes , have to cajun it to a lamp post."
2,2023-10-14,I pay for country wide access and some…,i pay for country wide access and some are good and some are just awful and i’m expected to pay extra to use substandard gyms like hereford. i hate the false representation of country wide use when reality of it is we have to increase our monthly subscription for less than impressive gyms
2,2023-10-15,Membership suspended,"hi team,  my name is shebin and ive been part of pure gym birmingham for about 4-5 months.  firstly, let me just say that im really happy to find a gym that is open late hours. considering my work schedule, its really hard to take care of myself from time to time when gyms close early. so, really happy.   however, my gym membership is suspended for 4days now and ive been trying to resolve this issue to the best that i can. the reason- not stacking the weights after the session. i completely understand the importance of safety and the health hazard this causes but ive been trying to work this out with the assistant manager of the gym for couple of days now. unfortunately, to no good end. im sure the gym realises the importance of maintaining good healthy lifestyle and how daily workouts impact the mental and physical state of a person. this issue is really saddening as being at the gym has taken a very good space in my daily routine and puregym has played a major role in it.  hopefully we can get this resolved soon  thanks shebin"
2,2023-10-15,showers,gym is fine showers need to be hot not luke warm especially the the price there charging my have to find another gym that can provide hot shower . if i want a shower that’s luke warm that i go to council gym and pay less money

3,2023-10-15,The Puregym equipment and facilities…,"the puregym equipment and facilities are very good, but i feel the air conditioning could be used more effectively - it just seems very warm a lot of the time (i know the gym users will be generating heat!)"
2,2023-10-15,The Pure gym business model is great.,"the pure gym business model is great.. however, as a paying customer, user, client even, i do not feel i get what i pay for, there are sometimes, several pieces of equipment out of commission, and they stay that way for days/weeks and even months, i totally appreciate, equipment, from time to time, will breakdown, need servicing etc, however, as a business, where by accessible, well maintained and functional equipment, equates to a better gym experience. the guys at park royal pure gym, who ever is in charge of the upkeep of all the equipment need to seriously get ontop of this, the multiple gym access, absolutely great and ideal for me and my lifestyle, however, visiting some pure gyms in east london, wow, absolutely disgusting, dishevelled changing room, equipment all over the place.. my gosh.. not naming (stratford) but man.. and can we do something about the unhealthy smell of certain people, like a promo body spray free give away.. i would love to be involved with that, istayfreshuk is a company that promotes freshness.. they sell bathrobes, mens underwear sets.. pure gym, you guys should contact them istayfreshuk ""its not just a brand, its a lifestyle"""

2,2023-10-15,Hygiene and Equipment,i am speaking on behalf of those who come to the gym and are unable to get their thoughts across. the hygiene in this gym is lacking i don’t understand how your a 24 hour gym but the equipment is dusty like no one is cleaning them equipment are out of order and are not fixed for months that shouldn’t be the case when your 24 hours as it’s always opened and the customers who use the gym increase therefore the availability of equipment is reduced. also there isn’t enough ladies only classes i do not believe that a man leading a ladies only session is ladies only defeats the whole purpose of the ladies having their own class

5,2023-10-15,Best gym I've ever been too!,"the best gym by far ive ever been too, plenty of equipment and lots of different classes to book on. the staff are great, always someone around to ask for help if needed and are always more than happy to help. the manager liam is always very welcoming and is always free for a chat whether it be about the gym or just to ask how you are. the gym itself is really clean, i always see someone around keep it clean and tidy. the showers in the ladies changing are great too.  i rarely have any problems getting on the equipment i want to use at the times i go and there is plenty of options to choose from with regards to equipment. overall i am really glad i joined this gym!"
3,2023-10-15,Look after your facilities,i like the location i don’t like whoever running the place because i have noticed too many times the water flavours is out (more than 10 times) not easy to find members of staff no customer service contact number

1,2023-10-15,Most of pt is rood and not helpful,most of pt is rood and not helpful. equipment is okay but person who working on puregym needs to be able to more focused on good relationships with customers. some people came to gym and made workout without pt because they don’t need them but if they need help the staff from gym should be able to help them but they not do that. customers pay money every month and we feel worse to people who choose pt. i have situations when i need help and person from staff say that i must find somebody else to help me because for 5 min she start her class. i feel like the person who is worse than people from her class. and was many different situations when i feel not comfortable because i use place or equipment which the pt want to use the time when  i made my workout because they’re customer needs that now. one times i ask one pt about how to used some equipment and she was very rood for me she answered me with nerves. i feel horrible because it was my first day on gym after my 9 months break.

4,2023-10-15,Great facilities for a great price,"overall i am very happy with the gym, the facilities and the prices. however, it is always a challenge to find weights in place as other members leave them anywhere. also sometimes when the gym is busy, some members occupy some equipment without exercising (they are busy on their phone) and are very inconsiderate of others that are waiting to use them."

3,2023-10-15,Good gym,"good gym, however, more and more machines are breaking or out of order so less machines to use.  showers having used them a few times, you have to check all of them to find a clean one as they are usually full of hair or not cleaned out after uses. plus the water isn’t always warm, normally only luke warm."

3,2023-10-14,"Bring your nerve, bring your zest, bring your personal best",my local gym is rather petite. there is not much apparatus for muscle accomplishment. as a grown male i can consistently bench 405 for reps but i was rather flabbergasted when some cleaner asked if he could clean my bench and proceeded to rambunctiously curl my max bench right before my eyes. it is quite the superior gym in my town and thus i would advocate to other gym goers.
3,2023-10-15,Puregym St Marks,something is always broken.  the gym should have a max capacity at 150 as after that you can have up to 5 people waiting for a machine. staff are friendly and so are the people in the gym. everything is well placed out and the sessions are brilliant..

1,2023-10-16,Dangerous group exercise class,"i attended a pump class which was fully subscribed (24participants). unfortunately there was not enough equipment to accommodate the numbers. in particular weights & barbell safety clips. i brought this to the attention of the class instructor who said “oh, there should be enough. i’m not using any clips. just be careful when you load your bar.” i was then forced to complete the class using a weighted barbell without safety clips to prevent the weights falling off. due to the number of participants there was not enough room in the studio to maintain a safe distance between each work station during exercise. on several occasions my bar clashed with the bar used by the person alongside me. to conclude, this class was poorly organised, over crowded & lacking enough equipment for a safe work out. i raised all of these issues with the duty manager who stated they had no choice but to deliver classes as directed by the group manager."

5,2023-10-14,There isn't really anything to…,"there isnt really anything to criticise.  its got a lot right.  machines for every body part, heavy enough dumbbells, enough equipment and space in the gym, 24 hour opening times, classes for every goal, an app that gives you everything from workout routines, training plans and even recipes, nutritional advice, and mental health/wellbeing tips. i have been using the personalised training plan feature for a few months and im probably in as good a condition as i have ever been, or close to it.  they do occasional challenges in my local gym which are also interesting to those who are competitively inclined.  the value for money is pretty much unrivalled in the fitness industry.  there are cleaners around the place on a regular basis and unlike alot of other (even big chain) gyms they have managed to keep they changing rooms and toilets in good working order and clean which makes for a more pleasant experience.  the staff are friendly and helpful and not pushy about selling pt services which is definitely a plus but they are clearly knowledgeable. the location of the gym itself is very convenient and parking is ample in capacity and free to use. overall it would take something phenomenal for me to consider moving to another gym but for now i remain a very satisfied customer. it wont let me choose the tamworth gym specifically but thats my local gym."

3,2023-10-14,The recent update at the Finchley East…,"the recent update at the finchley east end road gym has been well received, however my only two gripes are,  why on the first floor have they decided to shoehorn most of the weight machines into such a small space when there is such a large room adjacent. it really doesn’t make sense ?  there is so much wasted space.  the weight machines being on top of each other isn’t pleasant or particularly hygienic given the recent worries with covid.  the air conditioning is also never turned up high enough i think if they review these two faults then that would be a great improvement. the staff are helpful and friendly and the gym is good value"

3,2023-10-14,It’s a great gym,it’s a great gym. but there were two classes trying to outdo eachother on how loud their music was. and the instructors were shouting above that noise to make it worse. i’m all for some invigorating music but it was way too loud as a gym also needs to be an environment that gives you a peaceful workout if you want it and there was nowhere where the music was not overbearing.

5,2023-10-14,Attend the Linlithgow gym,attend the linlithgow gym. could do with a water fountain downstairs as well as upstairs. and id prefer if they provided spray and paper towels so people can clean down machines etc. otherwise cant fault it.
3,2023-10-14,Fitness Classes,evening classes need to cater for all levels of fitness.  i personally tend to use the gym equipment purely for the lack of variety of classes.  i would love to see salsa classes and bodytone classes held at convenient times in the evening.
2,2023-10-17,Barely carabiniers for the cable…,barely carabiniers for the cable machines. seem to be less and less each week and not being replaced (hardly expensive). one of the lat pulldown machines downstairs has a pin missing from the leg cushion meaning it cant be adjusted at all.

4,2023-09-29,Dropping weights.,"it’s really annoying when people drop weights in the gym.  perhaps one of the the team could quietly and gently remind them not to do so.  it obviously damages the weights and bars after a while, leading to unnecessary expense for the company. the team is very friendly and helpful.the gym has excellent facilities and up to date equipment.  handy to have towels.  useful vending machines with protein bars, energy drinks, towels and locks.  great gym! highly recommended!"

1,2023-10-13,"Overpowering sweat, and no AC","as soon as you enter the gym youre overwhelmed by the smell of sweat - on a daily basis. what are the cleaners doing? theres no ac - whats that about? after 10 minutes inside the gym you cant wait to get out of there for fresh clean air. from 8pm onwards kids who most definitely are not 16, more like 14 have taken over the place. nobody returns the weights. not many reasons to continue the membership here in all honesty - its a tip."

2,2023-10-14,Disabling class rights is unfair…,i think disabling after 3 class misses is unfair. this has happened to me and i’m not sure of your justification. i haven’t been to or booked a single class that is full. i also had to cancel one due to injury before - having to cancel within 4 hours of the class is excessive. it doesn’t allow for a last minute change of plan which can happen without warning - especially if you have children .

2,2023-10-14,2 star ratings,"my reason for my 2 star ratings.  i visited the gym on saturday 14th october and i have to say i was not impressed at the state of the gym.  members who were working out late definitely did not show any respect what so ever.  there was so much equipment not put away. the number of water bottles just left around was ridiculous and they did not use the bins provided.  i know new management are doing what the can to keep the gym in check however, state was out of control.  there is also a ridiculous number of spin bikes that need repairing or replacing. i had to try four bikes out before find one i could use for my spin session.  all in all not great for new members or existing members."
4,2023-10-14,Good Beginner Gym,"a standard gym for the price seeing as it has no sign up fee on a deal. however, lacks a lot machines such as hack squat, calf raise etc. especially for legs and can be impossible to get a machine at peak times. despite this the 24 hour aspect of the gym is amazing and means going at a quiet time can be made possible."

3,2023-10-13,Could be improved,"many of the evening classes are now only 30 minutes, instead of 45. they are not all at a time compatible with my family commitments. my usual 7pm yoga class today was not on and there was no suitable alternative."
1,2023-10-13,People dropping and throwing weights…,"people dropping and throwing weights down. personal training not controlling that and people leaving the weights all over the place. the ""special water"" machine ever so often doesnt work and its stupid to be limited to a little bit, i should be able to pour till my bottle is full. the aircon never really gets turned on so its always hot and sweaty in there. they have taken away one of the cleaning stations now i have to walk across the gym to get blue roll to clean a machine. i go there cos its cheap and close but thats all it is really, just a cheap low quality gym which i dont expect much out of or corporate to actually do anything. too many kids in the gym as well which makes it unpleasant. no respect in the gym at all and no control."
4,2023-10-13,I enjoy the gym,"i enjoy the gym. good equipment, respectful members etc. just wish it didn’t smell like wee in the atrium occasionally"

4,2023-10-13,The women area which was just open…,"the women area which was just open helps alots to improve the confident and comfortiability to all ladies in all different ages, races and level of fitness. that is help as all woman feel comfotable and can build great gym society. although, sometimes the music is not there or is not great. this can demotivate people from having great time and put all they have."

2,2023-10-16,The equipment is good but the gym is let down by,the equipment is good and the atmosphere is friendly and supportive but unfortunately this gym is let down by the poor maintenance and lack of basic facilities in the mens changing rooms specifically; - one of the 2 loos has had its seat missing for weeks - one of the 5 showers has been out of order for weeks - today one of the two soap dispensers above the basins was broken/ missing and the other had no soap in it. it wouldn’t take a lot to fix these things. this is very disappointing in a large national company.

4,2023-10-13,Not bad...service can be improved,"gallions reach pure gym, the gym is neat and tidy and has all the facilities you need to get a workout. but am not so satisfied at the fact that one morning we had a male (older gentleman) as a cleaner in the female changing rooms. he was cleaning the showers and i wanted to take a shower. its ideal to have female cleaners in the female rooms and male in male changing rooms. thanks 😊"

2,2023-10-12,Gym transactions are so weird,"gym transactions are so weird, they take money out of account randomly, like they dont give you the exact date for next transaction which results in them then randomly making the transaction and because of lack of funds then email you to charge £40 for the delay in payment, give an exact date for transaction so we have money prepared and saved for the gym. thanks."

4,2023-10-16,The gym has a great atmosphere,"the gym has a great atmosphere, but the machine that provides flavoured drinks is still broken and has been for weeks. a company of this size should be able to provide better maintenance on vending and other gym equipment considering its their bread and butter."

4,2023-09-23,Blinded by the sun!,"the last class i did was spin. i enjoy the class but felt unwell and had to stop because i was too warm from the sun.  in the autumn and spring the sun is low and comes through the window in that area on the side, near the staff room. it could do with an adjustable blind. the class is very well attended and it is difficult to get a bike at the other end of the class unaffected by the sunlight."
5,2023-10-16,Pure Gym Wicked,got two prs and a godly pump. i know that’s not what you are asking but i needed to tell you. the gym is spacious and staff are really friendly and useful. the equipment is all there and always working.

1,2023-10-16,Vaping permitted inChanging Rooms,this gym does not promote good health. the changing room smells of vapes. i have seen people vaping in them. the response is there isnothing saying you cant vape. i will be looking to move to a gym that promotes a healthy lifestyle.
4,2023-10-13,Feedback,only thing iv got to say is maybe for the gym to be a bit colder as the fans on the bikes and treadmills aren’t that great
3,2023-10-15,Overall gym is well laid out &…,overall gym is well laid out & equipment is satisfactory. however over the last couple of weeks ive probably bee 8 -10 times & unfortunately at least 2 of these there was no hand wash in the toilet area. i find this unsatisfactory at the best of times & even more so with the current covid climate. i have took to bringing my own just in case
5,2023-10-15,Fun time,"plenty of equipment, busy but you can always get on it, light, trainers on hand.  what’s not to like."
2,2023-10-15,Expected better big letdown by PureGym,stop the cleans from sleeping in male toilets. or sitting down hiding in the toilet on their phones. having seen it on many occasions. have them do the cleaning. every time you go into the male toilet always stinking and dirty very smelly. the clareness of the toilet is shameful. dont even see the staff wiping down the machines with disinfectant or a cleaning product every so often. i cant really recommend anybody to puregym as it is.
1,2023-10-02,Out of store hours parking!!!!,"attended 02.10.23 at 05.44am.  just received a notice for parking fine for £85.00. website says free parking at sainsburys! just been to the gym and spoken to the manager, no where are there signs telling you to enter your car reg to stop any fine in out of shop hours parking.  staff were simply not interested.  shame on pure gym for no notification either in the gym or on website, will have another fine landing on the mat tomorrow.  thank goodness was poorly and havent been since otherwise would be looking at £500!!!"
1,2023-10-14,Terrible pungent smell,"terrible pungent smell, ive been to numerous gym but the place smells really bad, no air ventilation or nor have a smelt an ari freshners.   numerous time, ive had a male cleaner come in whilst changing, makes me feel uncomfortable and due to religious reason.  i have spoken to few member of the ladies and the have agreed too, especially when were having a shower, some of us are not decent, for a man to come it is so uncomfortable and feel there is no dignity in this gym.."

4,2023-10-14,Good feeling gym,good feeling gym could do with some screens when on treadmills bikes etc to pass the time.

4,2023-10-15,Good equipment,"good equipment, good layout and 24/7 opening hours.  no punchbag though"
4,2023-10-15,Cheap and handy,"the gym is ok for me because it is located near where i live, and it is cheap , i just do my own thing in the gym because none of the classes suit me, in previous gyms i used to do spin classes and i thought this gym would also have them, that’s what it said on the website, but when i asked about them they said maybe in the future"
2,2023-10-15,Boost your glutes options,"please get more glute specific machines, there are so so many out there and other pure gyms have a much better selection. at newport, unless youve been able to get one or the few bars available and even one of the correct pads for hip thrusts, youve got one hip thrust machine and one hip abduction machine. considering how often the cables are in use, a few extension stands, hyperextension machine glute/ham developer and a kickback machine would make a difference. even more hip thrust stations would also help. if there could be a dedicated area, a ""glute workshop"" would make a real difference (and not only include one machine)"
4,2023-10-16,Lunchtime classes,"excellent circuits, bootcamp and bodytone classes held at lunchtime. the manager actually listens to your suggestions and actions them. loos are still a bit whiffy. not used the showers but not heard anyone complaining about the blocked drains so hopefully another problem solved."
5,2023-10-15,An impressive gym with everything to offer for a low monthly price!,"i have trained at puregym, macclesfield now for a couple of years. i trained for events including hyrox and a half marathon easily as the gym is equipped with plenty of kit, weights and cardio machines and they also provide varied classes throughout the day, every day, to suit everyone. im really impressed with the gym itself and the staff are very friendly and helpful. i have visited at various times of the day and some times are busier than others so it can be better to aim for the quieter times but it doesnt matter what time you go as everyone that goes there are nice, friendly and non judgemental. there is a good mix of people and everyone is made to feel welcome."
3,2023-10-15,Northwich,"northwich - really good macclesfield- really good warrington - brilliant wrexham - the place is in dire need of updating and cleaning, half the machines do no work and the place is run down"

3,2023-10-15,Good gym but there is some things they can do better,good gym but they don’t test the equipment so your at risk of injuring your self and they allow people to super set when it’s packed so your waiting 30/40 minutes for something
5,2023-10-16,After a three-day pass,"after a three-day pass, i joined the gym for good today. the whole environment is ideal for training. i used an online workout tailored for me, using the gym’s free wifi. the standard of the changing area, toilets and showers is excellent. all in all it’s definitely a huge step up from my previous gym, and a great deal cheaper!"
3,2023-09-01,crowded,"crowded, lack of equipment, the paid water machine has not been working for 2 weeks"
1,2023-10-13,Worst Gym Ever. Avoid at all costs!,"this is the worst gym ever. my stuff were stolen from my gym bag which was securely stored in a locker in the changing room. the gym itself is poorly ventilated, the equipment are obsolete and run-down, there is not enough machines to use when the gym is a little crowded, and there is no network coverage because the gym is on an underground floor. terrible experience. avoid at all costs!!"
1,2023-10-16,Vaping Now Allowed,i have been a member for some time. however my local gym stafford now allows vaping in the changing room which stinks from the smell of this. i was told that there is no notice that forbids this and as such people can vape. i am now looking for an alternative gym which promotes a healthy lifestyle.
3,2023-10-15,The gym itself is good but got some…,the gym itself is good but got some problems: 1) there are always problems with hot water in shower and usually it takes two months to fix it. 2) not enough equipment 3) price for membership goes up every 6 months 4) water machine for plus customers not working properly

4,2023-10-12,"Clean, spacious & well equipped","bath victoria park is by far the best puregym in the bath/bristol area and thats almost entirely down to its cleanliness. its the cleanest, most well-maintained puregym ive been to. its light, airy and spacious. equipment quality is good and damaged items are repaired quickly. plenty of lifting platforms which is a massive bonus. staff are very friendly. clients in the morning and daytime are friendly and courteous - i wouldnt advise going in the evenings though as this is where the more inexperienced, antisocial crowd arrive. music is terrible, of course, as its a chain gym, but not obnoxiously loud like others. they could benefit from having a glute-ham raise machine (niche complaint!) but otherwise has everything youd need. definitely well worth the price."
5,2023-10-15,Generally,"generally, i like everything, the only minus is that people dont exercise on machines, they sit on their phones and take up exercise space for up to 15 minutes, something had to be done about it"

1,2023-10-12,Worst gym,worst gym experience ever. they made cancellation membership so difficult. you can’t find cancel button on the app or website. it only direct you to customer service page which never replies. many days later they replied to me i have to pay one more month which i’m not going to use. very dodgy!
1,2023-10-16,Freezing cold…,this morning the gym was freezing cold and staff present were making excuses about being unable to correct as the air con temperature was centrally controlled. surely checking the temperature throughout the gym areas should part of the start of day checks?  please note i’m not normally a cold person.

2,2023-08-30,I have been training in gyms for 30…,"i have been training in gyms for 30 years and pure gym grantham is the unfriendliest place i’ve ever trained. when there are trainers at their station/podium you have to walk past them to get the the changing rooms upon entry. the only one that greets you with a smile and hello is mike, everyone else either doesn’t look up from their phones or has a face like a wet weekend……including the manager adam mee. the equipment is amazing but the environment is unwelcoming"
2,2023-10-13,Facilities…,"although the water temperature can now be classed as lukewarm rather than cold, it is still not comfortable and to wash in impossible to shave walls have been damaged in the locker room for months and kids still vaping in there reported this numerous times but nothing changes and no signage erected"
2,2023-10-14,I've been to quite a few PureGyms…,"ive been to quite a few puregyms around the country and i think the bournemouth one at the triangle is the worst ive been to. theres no cleaning station by the weights meaning very few people wipe their benches before/after use, something continuously leaks on me when im weight lifting, its overly crowded and everything is broken all the time - equipment, the lockers, the toilets, the hand drier hasnt worked for at least a few months and you cant wash your hands without being splashed by the tap.  all in all, its pretty gross to the point ive been looking at other gyms in the area and will be switching."
5,2023-10-15,Always available,working with a rota that change every three weeks among the 24 hours is been relieving find the puregym piccadilly. opening 24 hours per day it is giving me the chance to do not miss any work-out. i always find the gym clean and tidy as the changing room. puregym piccadilly is a very good gym.
5,2023-10-15,Nice bright airy gym,"nice bright airy gym, no issues using the equipment i want to use, really glad i moved to pure gym. (parking ok as well )"
1,2023-10-15,Refurb of Putney branch,"i have always been a big supporter of puregym and the service they offer. it is a no frills, well equipped, gym. however the recent refurbishment of the putney branch has been so poorly managed and disrespectfully communicated to the members that my opinions have plummeted. changing rooms have been closed with no notification despite me emailing the branch to ask if there were going to be any closure of the changing facilities. health & safety is another concern as works are being carried out with gym members on site. trip hazards are blatantly ignored and large items of furniture are being carried up and down the internal stairs with members arriving and leaving. it is very dangerous."
5,2023-10-12,"Really good experience at all times ,I…Perfeto","really good experience at all times ,i use this gym in between shifts at work even at late night i am always safe and have a good use of the equipment that is always in good condition."

3,2023-10-15,Price is good customers bad,"price is good, too many teenagers hanging around in big groups like its a park, . i wouldnt allow anyone younger than 18. the smell in there is horrible, but i suppose cant ask much for that price."
3,2023-10-14,Great value for money but the front…,"great value for money but the front automatic door was stuck at the weekend (about midday on saturday) and unfortunately it was unstaffed and there is no direct contact number for the gym/manager, so we were stood outside for 10 minutes before another customer came out and was able to let us in. they could do with a notice in the front door for out of hours emergencies/issues."

3,2023-10-15,I like the atmosphere and equipment,i like the atmosphere and equipment. but i don’t like the waiting time to use equipment. i sometimes wonder if the gym is over subscribed?
3,2023-10-12,PureGym are SO slow at fixing and replacing stuff,there is always at least one machine broken or not working - e.g stair machine broken for about 3 weeks. the drink machine was broken for over 1 month which is obviously annoying as i pay extra to use it. the scales to weigh yourself are broken too. the toilets are 🥴  pure really need to be so much faster fixing and replacing things.  bright side - good equipment and the staff are 10/10 - big love to them all
5,2023-10-12,Clean,"clean, tidy, someone always around to help, good range of equipment"
4,2023-10-15,More Cleaning Options Please,"gym is decent, pricing good and atmosphere good. one minor quibble, equipment doesn’t seem to be cleaned regularly enough. members should be encouraged to keep equipment clean, this may be achievable if the gym were willing to provide sprays and/or wipes."

5,2023-10-12,Favourite gym,"puregym is hands down my favourite gym. they have all the amenities needed (obviously), plus the fact that they have a cleaning station is just amazing and not a lot of gyms have that! their environment is always super clean, and as someone who needs a clean environment to feel comfortable, i don’t find any other gym as good as puregym. keep up the good work!"
5,2023-10-12,Great venue and vas…,great venue and value.could perhaps introduce a one way system for the car park.otherwise excellent.
2,2023-10-15,As a cyclist i use the cycling machines…,as a cyclist i use the cycling machines a lot...the computer on your machines hasnt been working for months. its winter time am exercising blandingly...i have tried to explain this to the stuff but when its more than 6 months it show how proffessional your company is...i moved from the gym were i never had such issues...right now am thinking otherwise
5,2023-10-15,Great clean gym.,a great clean gym with a lot of equipment and friendly staff. all you could want from a gym.

4,2023-10-12,Overall I’ve got no issues with this…,"overall i’ve got no issues with this gym, but some equipment could do with repairs or upgrades. although this would not stop my workout, as i would find alternative solution, others though maybe a little more precious"
2,2023-10-15,Poorly equipped. Wasted space,compared to its main competitor in the town (jd gyms) it is very poorly equipped. the area to the left as you walk in is completely wasted with very little equipment. i think you will find that once the initial 12 month offer has expired many people will leave unless things are improved. this review relates to the new gym at shrewsbury.
4,2023-10-15,The ladies changing room does smell…,the ladies changing room does smell quite bad if i’m honest. i don’t understand why yoga payment has increased. but apart from that i like it :)
1,2023-10-15,The building is far too small for the…,the building is far too small for the amount of people that want to use it. there is an upstairs but due to some stupid reason it is closed off when it should be open. there are too many people using it at the one time that i am going to cancel my membership
1,2023-10-15,worst customer service I ve seen in a…,"worst customer service i ve seen in a gym , bad maintanance on machines and lockers , faulty fountains and janga all the time , faulty machines all the time, very bad music, unleveled floor ."
5,2023-10-09,The staff are friendly and welcoming,"to be honest if it wasnt for the personal trainer i booked, i probably wouldnt come back.  he is polite, knowledgeable and has been extremely helpful.  the staff are friendly and welcoming.  i feel my confidence is building and enjoying the gym for the first time ever."

5,2023-10-12,I would rate this gym a five star…,i would rate this gym a five star brilliant customer service especially from the gentleman who signed me up always greats me upon entering the gym i suffer with social anxiety my self and they took that into consideration and everyone who goes pure gym does their own thing there are no arguments or anything unlike some other gyms.
3,2023-10-11,Parking,"i am happy with the gym staff and equipment but i have an issue with the way customers use disabled car parking spaces. it is clear they are not disabled and are using the spaces because they are wider and they appear to feel entitled to use them to protect their cars. the staff do not challenge this behavior because they are either unaware, which i doubt, or simply do not want to upset any customers."
3,2023-10-12,Not bad apart from the many broken…,"not bad apart from the many broken lockers, some even have chewing gum attached. you get what you pay for i guess."
2,2023-10-15,Very bad experience,"not enough small equipment (e.g handles). bathroom is dirty and smells terrible. i wonder if it is the way puregym prevents people from taking a shower to save costs. not shower at gym after a couple of first days, could not stand horrible smell and dirtiness  (the gym bathroom is much better)"
5,2023-10-15,Excellent,spacious and a great location.
4,2023-10-15,Mostly great,"puregym salisbury is great for the majority of the time, the equipment is good and staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  the only thing letting it down is how long it takes for equipment to get fixed when it breaks - of course things are going to break occasionally, they get some heavy use and nothing lasts forever but equipment is out for ages when it breaks, there must be a way to get things fixed faster."
4,2023-10-15,Access 24/7 only negative is that…,access 24/7 only negative is that showers not very powerful and always not very clean
2,2023-10-10,Showers and Cardio equipment,"the showers are a massive problem. there is something wrong with them every few months. the smell from the sinks in the toilets are also overwhelmingly disgusting. due to limited cross trainers when even one is out of action it affects a lot of people. but apart from all those things the gym is clean and tidy. all the other equipment is in good working order. pleasant atmosphere, great class timetable. on a good day i would definitely give it a 5 stars…"
4,2023-10-12,24/7,well equipped but recently the ac doesnt work in a part of the gym

3,2023-10-15,Honestly I feel very light headed in…,"honestly i feel very light headed in the gym especially on leg day. both me and my friends often tell each other that we don’t feel very well as in feeling sick. i think this is something to do with the air conditioning, lack of air flow and lack of windows leading to all artificial lighting.  the gym equipment is relatively good but there’s 3 things it really needs - a pull-up bar which isn’t so slippery i have to readjust every one pull-up i do, a back machine for talker guys that allow for a better stretch and more natural motion then the average rowing machine it has which feels unnatural and more bicep focused in the end of the rep, and finally another triceps extension machine because it’s almost always taken."

2,2023-10-12,RESPECT THE GYM,"1. staff should be a lot more vigilant ! banning people for dropping weights. banning people for dropping machinery. banning people for not putting weights away. since the monthly gym membership has gone up the equipment has gotten very worn and tatty. needs repairing or replacing as if it was a new gym just opening. gym is just lacking big time with equipment quantity in every department !  staff need to speak up when ever any piece of equipment is not being treated properly !  dont allow people to take dumbbells from the dumbbell area, they never get put back !"
2,2023-10-15,Dangerous cycles and locked toilets,"i have raised 8 times with different puregym staff at finchley rd gym about the bikes speed level suddenly accelerating from 1 to 19 and above and with a recovering broken ankle, this is quite hard. it happens after 25 minutes of cycling but nothig has been done about it. also the disabled toilet should be open for use for others, why have a vacant toilet, when then one needs to go downstairs which are often out of order?"
5,2023-10-15,Good gym,"good gym, with good staff. both pts and cleaning staff are really good, welcoming and nice."
2,2023-10-15,Let down by non existent customer services,"easier to leave the mafia than this place!  trying to cancel but unable to do so via the app but impossible to speak to anyone or get a response. shame really, as the gym experience itself was good (for the money) - just left due to changing circumstances.  given up trying to contact and will cancel direct debit. thanks for reminder trustpilot!"
5,2023-10-15,Tamworth,the gym isn’t too big so there is a lovely atmosphere. staff are really nice. doesn’t seem a lot of people preening and posing for selfies just people who want to work out which is great as i’m overweight and in my 50s so doesn’t make me feel self conscious

4,2023-10-15,Great value for money,"i am enjoying the gym so far. less expensive than my old one and a decent variety of early morning classes. only improvement i could suggest would be for classes to be mixed up a bit so its not the same thing every week? i love variety. would be great if early birds could get the occasional step class or some body combat or something! 😊 but i love all the classes i go to, and the instructors are great."
3,2023-10-15,Instruction is great but it would be…,instruction is great but it would be good to have a more varied class schedule i.e. it would be nice to have a pump class in the evening on weekdays. also yoga or pilates would be great. otherwise very happy.

5,2023-10-15,It's good for the price,"its good for the price. but then again i dont have heigh expectations: any place with sport equipment where i can move, burn calories and produce endorphins is fine. its does not  rain on my head and i can take  a shower afterwards. the showers where i went were kept clean, i am easily grossed out if they are not. the downside is that ... it often smells, ventilation is poor. but i do have very sensitive sense of smell. i ve never been to a gym that smelled like flowerbeds. so overall, it served the purpose. i had to quit, because i moved out, and i have different gym nearby."
5,2023-09-18,The staff are friendly and welcoming,the staff are friendly and welcoming. the gym is open 24/7 which shows me especially with work. it’s just a nice place to work out in and no one is judging you.

3,2023-10-15,Getting back to basics,"my concern regarding pure gym, is that it was once a low cost option,  providing enough equipment and support to cater you a members needs for improved health and wellbeing.  however your costs are now bordering on the lower rung of more expensive gyms which provide a lot more variety and comfort..  you need to get back to what you are best at  which is  providing a low cost option"

5,2023-10-15,A great gym.....however,"good value, good equipment,  good vibe in the gym. one thing i really do not like though is the frequent attempts to upsell more expensive memberships or bolt-on services. i dont mind being asked occasionally as things can change, but really i find it a big negative that you keep trying to upsell to me."

5,2023-10-14,I attend PureGym at Borough,"puregym at borough have an amazing trainer called kassidy chaplin who does excellent classes, is full of energy which he passes on and is very attentive helping everyone do the exercises in the correct way. he has even created meal recepies which he provides for free. sam austin, another trainer, is also very good and extremely kind and motivating. karl williams pg delivering the yoga classes is als sooo kind and goes above and beyond to correct everyones posture during the exercises. the only dissadvantage for puregym in borough is that their classes studio is rather small and frequently gets too jammed to fit everyone. also during rush hours i.e. between 17:30-20:00 it is very difficult to find machines available to use."
3,2023-10-15,Low quality,many treadmills broken tissues not always available for cleaning studio closed for maintenance for two months
2,2023-10-14,Please read and take action,"- music is low or off with poor selection - staff not welcoming unless your interested in pting - should have a set temperature for the gym - equipment not cleaned regularly - air freshener in toilets/changing rooms - equipment everywhere on weekends - under 16s using the gym no supervision  i could keep listing but the above would be a great start, under 16s can use the gym totally fine with that but groups of 4+ training is crazy, form terrible they will hurt themselves. why not have a select time they can use the gym off peak when you have staff that can help them in their training compulsory induction perhaps."

3,2023-10-15,Classes,"the classes are of a poor standard at the moment compared to what’s been on offer in the past. also, 30 minute classes are pointless as 5mins at the beginning is a warm up and 5mins at the end is a cool down. i’d love to see more 45?min classes back on the timetable."

1,2023-10-15,The worst!,"quite possibly the worst gym i’ve ever been to and used. unfortunately it’s convenient, on my way to work and cheap. however it’s dirty, hasn’t been updated in 8 years and the equipment is often broken. absolute nightmare of a gym!"
3,2023-10-15,Cheap but can’t get on equipment,price is very good but the downside is that no matter when you go you either have a long wait for some equipment or you can’t get on them at all.  classes as limited with those that i would be interested in happening during the day when i work.

2,2023-10-15,Decent gym horrible smell,decent range of  equipment but every pure gym you go to has that distinct smell of sweat and bo. all the gyms have fans and ac but they are never turned on and i’m paying £58 a month to go to any gyms in the country as i’m always travelling so overpriced as hell.

1,2023-10-15,"Dark, dingey, limited kit","i have got to be honest. pure gym just is not the one, i can’t talk for the others but wrexham just is not a vibe. it’s disgustingly busy, always. and the kit is extremely limited in terms of weights, if you want a treadmill (assuming it is working!) there a loads. but the actual kit is sparse, there is next to no room to train if you’re doing cardio or your own workouts if there is a class on. it’s always dirty, no day light, it’s so dingey and genuinely stopped me using the gym as it was low key depressing going there.  no offence to those who use this gym regularly, if it works for you, it works for you but it has never been and will never be a gym that i enjoy attending. i’d much rather drive to chester ‘gym group’ than go here."

4,2023-10-15,Pure gym is great value for money,"pure gym is great value for money. the equipment is good ,although when a piece of equipment is ""out of order"" it takes too long to get fixed. having said that as long as you dont visit in peak hours you can usually get to use the equipment you need to complete your workout. the range of classes are good as well. to be honest its hard to beat for value for money."
3,2023-10-14,Some of the equipment makes screeching…,"some of the equipment makes screeching noises when being used such as the leg press machine, in my opinion there should be an expansion to the gym due to how many people come in at all times everyday as it not only stresses those waiting for the machines to be free but the people already on them. overall, its okay and the staff are friendly."

3,2023-10-14,Needs improvement,"generally good variety of gym equipment, but poorly maintained. bits missing on equipment, like the bottle holders. unfortunately, a lot of users seem to think it acceptable to sit on the machines on their phones or resting between sets. notices should state this is unacceptable the lockers are generally in a bad state though with a lot unusable. obviously very cheap construction and highly risky to leave anything valuable inside. dont like the fact that you need to enter a code to exit. seems a major safety risk if someone needs to escape quickly (from attack for instance). needs more 10kg dumbells. i only saw one pair. showers too cold and cannot adjust. also, broken and missing shelves/baskets"

5,2023-10-14,Good all around gym to join with no contracts.,pure gym is by far the easiest to join and the best thing about joining is you get the most out of your money so many locations to pick from so when travelling some where in the country you can still sneak a session in.

3,2023-10-06,PureGym at Drakehouse,puregym at drakehouse do not have some equipment such as a hatchsquat which i loved using when the gym was places as it was really good for quads. they do have adductor and abductor machines which places didnt have so that is good. another omission is a traditional pec dec as the pecfly machine puts a huge strain on the shoulder as the hand grips are so wide. also with the shoulder press and chest press machines the resting positions for the weight stack is so low that to raise it up to start the exercise also puts a huge strain on the shoulder joint. when the gym was places these machines had a foot lever where you could raise the weight up to the starting position and so avoid this. there are some very good machines though (no problem with most of them !)

5,2023-10-14,I was not a confident person,"i was not a confident person, i arrived for my induction and felt comfortable. i liked the fact that all classes were included in my membership, i also gained a discount through my employer. after 2 weeks of doing a few classes i decided to enlist the help of a personal trainer who works for/with puregym, this has helped me so much, made me more confident with the equipment and i am seeing the fruits of my labour thanks to the support and guidance"

4,2023-10-14,Good but needs polishing,overall the gym is ok however some equipment lately have been broken and alot of children have been in and basically messing round in my opinion. also sanitisation stations are empty quite often. that said overall its a good gym.
4,2023-10-14,Pure Gym Reviewed:good and bad,good range of equipment. amazingly large space to work out in. pleasant staff. the downside on this site is the inability of the landlord to fix persistent leaking of the roof when it rains heavily. the area where the dumbbells are located is usually soaked when this occurs. the taunton branch had to close recently as a result of this.

1,2023-10-14,Is this what gyms have become?,"in all my years of training i have never experienced such a horrid gym. its rammed full of large groups who longer around equipment, no matter the time of day it just seems swamped. worst of all, you dont seem to be able to move without bumping into a full video production setup of camera, tripod, mics and even on one occasionally a video light. cant people just crack on with a workout that doesnt involve filming for ticktock, the last thing i want is to be in the background of some video as im sweating and grimacing my way through a workout or being given dirty looks because i have walked into frame of some wannabe instagram model sticking her rear end into a camera."

2,2023-10-14,Multiple subscriptions WARNING,"the company have a very stupid system where if multiple subscriptions are linked to the same bank account. they will close down your accounts even though you mention to the staff ahead of time, resulting in losing all data from the last 10 months. needing to re-join and pay the joining fee again. this system is stupid and should not exist. if people have 6 or more accounts i can accept such steps need to be in place but not for 3 accounts. this is perfectly normal for the main income holder of a household to pay for himself/partner and son from the same bank account. it also means the fob that cost £6 is disconnected and needs to be re-connected to the new account. fix this puregym and you would easily have a 5 from me"

1,2023-10-14,You get what you pay for,"i paid for the higher package, it was a waste of money. the higher package is supposed to give you the option of booking the next week classes in advance. as i only do classes and classes are cleverly 30mins majority. (usually book 2 a day to get 1 hr exercise) which means.. 1. 20mins exercise by time warm up is over. (two classes actually only work out 40mins in the hour. 2. max classes you can book is 8, which means i couldn’t book the week after, even though i was paying more.  to enter the gym you use you app pass to get in. well it wasn’t registering me correctly, so even though i was in class and got ticked of a paper registrar, they accused me of not turning up to class via email. consequently blocked me from booking classes and cancelled all my classes i had booked. i direct messaged the gym, they said they would fix it. 1 week later, i messaged again to say i still can’t book, i just got a response 9 days later (yesterday) saying please come in and we will try fix it again.  too late… i’ve already registered with another gym and cancelled.  also zumba, pilates, yoga is an extra cost. this is good to know before you join.  there was only one changing room in whole gym for the ladies and two showers (of which one started dribbling half way through and had to change to the other one to wash soap out of hair). they make it so small and hard work on purpose, so you won’t use the services.  the classes are a joke, non experienced instructors, disorganised, waste of time."

3,2023-10-12,Needs more weights upstairs and certain machines need to be altogether,"i know all gyms are different and they all have different ways of doing things, but i find everything is all scattered randomly for example all upper body machines is all over the place and upstairs, the lower body machines not all by the other lower body machines. it doesn’t look like it’s cleaned thoroughly… the one day i was there doing my session there was finger prints all over the mirror upstairs there’s hardly any staff about no matter what time i go and it’s always at different times of the day and different times depending on my work. there’s not a lot of weights upstairs either where you do your ab workouts. when a class is on downstairs it’s so loud as the instructor has a microphone on and i have to turn up the volume on my earphones. also the classes upstairs aren’t that private and it’s not that sound proof either so you can hear people who are working out and it’s not very relaxing when you are doing a yoga class. it needs to be more sound proof and private for that. a window would suffice as you can see on the timetable what’s on and if youd be interested to join that class in the future. for me genuinely it has a lot of things that need to improve and need more weights upstairs as sometimes you can’t go in to the gym classroom where the classes are on as some instructors board up the door to stop entry."
5,2023-10-12,No1 Gym,"the gym has a really friendly atmosphere and the personal trainers are all lovely and totally approachable. i especially love all of the classes, i’d say i’ve tried most of them now!"
5,2023-10-12,Well equipped gym and although it was…,well equipped gym and although it was busy never really have to wait for equipment
4,2023-10-12,Good range of equipment,"been using the gym for just over a month as an off peak member. overall it a very good gym with a friendly atmosphere, a very good range of equipment and not usually a long wait to get in your sets. whilst no-one going to a gym should be criticised i do think the staff could do more to support the behaviour of the young (16-19) majority membership at off peak times, most of whom come for the local schools. the poor technique, use of equipment and inappropriate behaviour could all be addressed rather than ignored. many of these younger members are just doing junk volume and will not maximise their training."
5,2023-10-12,I have had no issues at all.,i have had no issues at all. getting in with with my code.. the app.. services are excellent

4,2023-10-12,Pleasantly surprised,"good size gym, upgraded machines & more benches for free weights, overall i can’t complain so far."
1,2023-10-12,Physically assaulted by staff member,"i was physically assaulted by a staff member at this gym for trying to close a door of a room where a class suddenly started bellowing out booming music right behind me as i tried to have a quiet cardio workout to temporarily take my mind off the fact i have not long found out my mother has incurable cancer, (as i couldn’t even hear the programme i was streaming on my earphones at full volume). the staff member who shoved me in the chest was sarcastic, aggressive and rude even after i pointed out what they had done was commit assault. shocking."
4,2023-10-12,Sometimes people spend more time…,"sometimes people spend more time checking their socials sitting on their phones, its not a internet cafe. equipment is good easy to use have yet to use free weight area."
3,2023-10-13,Not enough machines,"not enough machines, benches or weights to cater for busy periods. plenty of space so it should be utilised by adding more equipment."

4,2023-10-12,I like the gym at Salford…,"in general i like the gym at salford and the staff are very helpful.  a bit frustrating is how many lockers are broken and that people put bags and coats in lockers without a padlock. i think there should be a sign to discourage that.  my main reason for moving to virgin active is the pool, jacuzzi, wet and dry sauna. of course it is also more expensive."
5,2023-10-12,Very convenient and  really good gym,convenient cheap good classes good set of equipment
5,2023-10-12,Pure Gym Cheetham Hill,"pure gym cheetham hill - great gym is well-maintained and clean, the cleaning staff are always very pleasant and the staff are knowledgeable. i would like to suggest more stretching classes as valuable feedback and can contribute to enhancing the gyms offerings. providing a variety of classes can help cater to different fitness needs and preferences."
3,2023-10-12,I liked there was plenty of equipment,"i liked there was plenty of equipment, but it was very over crowded most days with a lot of teenagers just standing around using to much space.. this is stevenage hertfordshire"
3,2023-10-12,Decent Gym with Hygiene Concerns,"ive been a regular at puregym for some time now, and i feel its important to share my experience. while the gym has many positive aspects, cleanliness has consistently been a concern. the equipment is well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful, which is why im giving it 3 stars.  however, the cleanliness issue is hard to ignore. ive noticed that the cleaning and sanitization of the premises could be improved. sometimes, the sanitation stations are either empty or not properly stocked. its vital, especially in the current climate, that we have a clean and hygienic environment to work out in.  i believe with a little more attention to cleanliness, puregym could easily earn a higher rating from me and many others. its a fantastic place to work on your fitness goals, but i hope the management takes this feedback constructively and makes the necessary improvements."
3,2023-10-01,STOP THE ZUMBA,great gym but the workout classes end about 30 minutes later (especially zumba) then scheduled. this is annoying to me and a lot of other people as it prevents use of the studio. which i use for a lot of my workout. its getting to the point that i cant complete my workout. please do something about this or at-least update the website . otherwise great gym xxx linda -edit this is especially an issue on tuesdays and thursdays

5,2023-10-12,It's pretty cool,well ive been to a couple of pure gyms and i have to say they are not to bad. i sometimes go to the birmingham west one and it has most of the equipment i need but i do feel it is a bit small in comparison to the the one in west brom( which i feel has everything i need). its good and im getting bigger and stronger and fitter.  its 5 stars from me
4,2023-10-12,Opening times suit my shift work,opening times suit my shift work. main gym is really clean and tidy. could use more treadmills. possibly a tv or something to look at whilst using the treadmill as it is quite awkward staring at the wall or people coming and going from the gym

4,2023-10-07,Great place,"great place, big space, everybody comfortably doing their exercise but unfortunately who comes for exercise not respectful for others. throwing (literally throwing) dumbbells to floor as if he thinks lifting couple of hundreds kg!!!! also ive seen someone cutting his beard front of mirror with scissors and blow them on to floor with hair dryer. some people goes to shower with bare foot, i dont think you want to step on somebody elses hair. i think would be nice to put more signage, maybe even on the floor (where the dumbbells on), like please put your weights to right place, dont shave/cut your hairs/beards in changing room for health and hygiene reasons please. and last one how often equipment gets checked? news would be nice let people know they can feel safe equipment and encourage them to report it."
5,2023-10-12,First time I have ever used a gym at 66 yrs old,"first time i have ever used a gym, and at 66 years young i did not think that i would fit in. but i wrong, i was made so welcome by all the staff, they were helpful, understanding and to be truth full they made me feel that they really cared. it was obvious that they actually enjoy and are dedicated in what they do. even the cleaning staff are polite and helpful. i enjoy it so much that i am there most days and also take advantage of the free classes, sometimes i get carried away and do two classes one after the other. a great team thank you crewe retail park"
3,2023-10-12,Convenient but often messy,"its super convenient that the gym is open 24 hours as i work shifts, but the lack of any staff in the wee hours of the morning means nothing is ever where its supposed to be when im there. i often cant find the weights i want without searching for 5 minutes first. if theres an inconsiderate gym user at 11pm that leaves a mess then its going to be a mess all night.  the equipment is kept in good order and theres also a good variety. when one of the machines were damaged recently it was repaired much faster than other gyms ive used in the past.  parking is nearby but limited to 2 hours... 2 hours isnt a long time."

1,2023-10-12,Dissapointing,i would love to give puregym 5 stars and i would if i was able to use the equipment properly but im disabled and the access lift to the upper floor has been out of order for almost 2 months
3,2023-10-12,I like this gym,"i like this gym , there is a nice atmosphere , no one really bothers you and its quite relaxed  my only feedback would be that it would be useful to have sanitiser wipes onsite. i have only seen the machines being cleaned once and it gives me the ick. its a big job to clean all of those machines down so if we had the wipes available , fussy people like me 😊 could be responsible for cleaning the surface areas"
3,2023-10-12,Doesn't have lots of different classes…,"doesnt have lots of different classes in the morning. but perfect location, staff and very clean."
3,2023-10-12,Almost 8-9 out of 10,"in terms of equipment, its got just about everything you need, is serviceable and clean. toilet and showering facilities could be cleaner, locker area is generally clean and tidy. my main issue is the atmosphere. i feel as though gym users are quite guarded, particularly female gym users, ive noticed the poster campaign around the gym around harassment, so i assume there has been issues there. it doesnt feel like a community, or perhaps its just not my type of training environment."
3,2023-10-12,Good points and bad points,it all depends on which gym i go to i was going to leeds north for the past four months but just recently its been really messy and smells bad so i have started going to leeds corn exchange it could be better some lockers are broken and it appears someone is living inside the gym the drinks vending machine is sometimes broken i complained on google and got a response saying sorry about the water machine was out of order and i should tell the manager but this is not what i was complaining about apart from that its really nice

3,2023-10-12,"Make it brighter, and appeal to older age groups more!","i am 60, joined this summer and like it better that i thought i would! however it’s noisy and dark which makes communication a bit difficult, and a more open, inviting, inclusive, less macho, aesthetic would be an improvement.  it would be better… …if it was brighter and lighter …if it was quieter, and looked and sounded less like a night-club …if it had better music, and not so loud! …if the machines were numbered so i could remember which ones i need to go on easier …if the decor wasn’t so relentlessly, boringly, macho …if you had a bar somewhere to give support when doing stretching and exercises …if you had a low balance beam to walk along and improve one’s balance …if you had poster suggesting stretching exercises etc …if you offered classes in yoga, and more dance based classes …if more effort was made to consider and accommodate the needs of older people. …and it could be more fun!! my dream gym would have large hula hoops, skipping ropes, and adult size swings, with more of a trendy coffee shop with good music taste vibe!  attracting older age groups would be good. older people have way more to gain, in some ways than the younger people. you should encourage them to bring their parents along and sign them up! it was my adult daughter’s persuasion that made me give it a go, so i don’t end up as disabled and immobile as her grandmother, my mum, is, at 86.  (i though it was pure gym was asking me for feedback, not trustpilot! ah well, i’m saying it all anyway…)"

3,2023-10-12,Very impressive but somewhat limited in certain areas,"i liked most things about pure gym, the few things that makes my mouth sour are, that the basic plan is far more limited than i would like, pausing the gym membership start at the end of a month instead of the day i want to pause it and unlock it 30 days after."

5,2023-10-11,Who knew gym could be so easy? - Jemma!!,"i’ve been with jemma for a year now (our anniversary was just last week ha ha!!). what can i say! jemma’s been so lovely and supportive. our sessions are always something else and there’s never a dull day with jemma. starting off a fitness journey can be scary, and people often fear judgement, but jemma makes it all so easy. jemma’s core principle is confidence. this time last year i struggled with nutrition and low self-esteem but ever since i embarked on this journey with jemma there’s been a change. i’m less nervous at the gym, and more confident in doing workouts alone. whilst helping to achieve your goal/goals, jemma also makes sure you’re building confidence and feeling comfortable in your own skin/body. jemma takes things at your pace but she’s sure to push you to achieve more, even beyond what you thought you were capable of! every achievement is celebrated with jemma, be it big or small. even if you feel stuck, jemma is always so supportive. if you’re thinking of starting gym and feeling a bit lost, i would really recommend taking on jemma as a pt."

1,2023-10-10,Unacceptable Conditions in Our Showers,"im extremely disappointed with the state of our showers. theyre not only dirty but also in disrepair, and its disheartening that management has been unresponsive to our concerns. this lack of maintenance and attention is completely unacceptable. we deserve better!"

2,2023-10-10,Something constantly broken,"this could be great gym, sadly there are a few issues that make it less so. machines are constantly out of order, especially cables and it takes weeks to get them repaired. the leg extension machine was broken twice in a row, adduction machine was out of order for about a month, and at least one cable machine is broken nearly constantly. on top of this i had to bring my own d clip since they keep disappearing. i understand that some people take them but there are solutions. if i can find some, i am sure a company of this size can too. and most annoying of all is the fact that the mens toilet is most of the time out of soap...seriously..."

1,2023-10-10,Lazy staff,"lazy staff  ive just cancelled my membership as not for the first time, a class has been been cancelled. i was told when i arrived by a manager that he would not be taking the class as i was the only one to show up and ""its just not worth it""  allowing me to come to the gym and cancelling on the spot because he cant be bothered.  previous occasion the pt was downstairs while 10 of us were in the room, he rushed to take the calss so a member ended up taking it. i have the written apology for this one but a second time is just an insult.  membership cancelled  edit, thanks for your reply. i was offered a free month by customer services. ive declined this as i went the next day for another class. surprisingly as only two of us turned up this was also cancelled. the reason being that if three or fewer people show up the management has instructed the trainers to cancel the class and focus on cleaning."
4,2023-10-10,Great gym open 24/7,"great gym open 24/7 , lots of different equipment & friendly people."
3,2023-02-18,Maintain and support,"where do i start…….it was between 2* and 3* it seems to go through stages this gym gets a new manager or deputy manager ( not sure who they are now ) in and it seems to get clean again and the equipment seems to get cleaned and maintained then it goes down hill again.  a lot of the machines and maintenance is seriously lacking, things need updating and it’s not been kept on top of the equipment is not kept clean or maintained.  the cleaning is hit and miss there is cleaning stations for you to wipe down equipment but upstairs is always hit and miss no spray or towels when the cleaners are not there.  downstairs there are weights left out all over even though there are plenty of staff which should be asking and ensuring these are kept in place .  there are loads of personal trainers if you want to hire one but seems to be lacking on the core staff walking around seeing if the gym and it’s customers are ok and the gym is clean and tidy and the maintenance of the equipment is kept up.  all in all if you just want a gym to go which is open 24/7 and go in and do what you need to do with no extras then it’s good"
4,2023-10-09,There need to be more variety of classes,"there would need to be more variety of classes, always the same. otherwise its a good gym."
1,2023-10-08,General feedback,"general feedback, the review responses by puregym are generic and usually incorrect.  many responses state feedback is taken onboard or pure gym take this feedback to inprove for their members. sadly this is not the case. usually the feedback is ignored or changes are not implemented.  it’s also clear this is a generic response team that don’t know the local gym environment why are commenting on, or making excuses for.  just another disappointing reason that puregym is not number one for its members :("
3,2023-10-09,Air con off?,was in the beaufort park gym tonight but it was extremely warm in there. i noticed a member of staff from the class section that was going on came out to ask another member of staff to turn the air con up as it was too hot during the class. the cleaning stations were empty although there was sufficient paper towels there werent any sanitiser to wipe down some of the natural greasy/sweat marks this added with the heat made it slightly uncomfortable tonight. busy gym though and seemed friendly enough in there.
4,2023-10-09,Great gym,great gym  plenty of equipment and weights of good quality. the app steps you through gym routines so it would be great if they had a phone holder in the equipment so you could see the countdown counter whilst doing the displayed exercise. .
4,2023-10-09,Is this gym 24 hours as I got a email…,is this gym 24 hours as i got a email saying its unstaffed from 12am till 6amand can still use the facilities? but in the reviews it says opens at 6am?

5,2023-10-09,The ideal gym. I recommend it without hesitation,"fully equipped gym, very clean, comfortable and friendly environment and staff ready to serve you. the prices very affordable. open twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week."
1,2023-10-09,Too packed,"too packed , since the renovations which was supposed to improve the gym, they made it worst and more cramped, they actually made the free weights area much smaller!! it’s now a health and safty risk and hazardous, with weights all over the floor and never on the rack, and it’s super tight so you’re having to step over people whilst they train ….it’s mad dangerous now !!  treadmills either face the wall! or the at the immediate entrance - so as people enter the gym they walk in front and behind you! feels and looks awkward. it’s now all disjointed and messy.  atmosphere has become dead too, many of serious people that used to train at pure gym have now left leaving by in large mainly school/college students training socially and in large groups, each doing their sets, so equipment is never available when you need it.  managers don’t really care. i and others have raised it numerous times with them. and likely pure gym will reply to this review with some generic template, ( of how popular and busy they are!) … not bothering to tackle each point raised… so nothing will ever get done about it. sorry for the rant, but most regular gym goers i have spoken to largely feel the same. would i join this gym as a new gym goer, save your yourself the disappointment. there are other better gyms. only good thing about this gym, parking and location…nothing else."

1,2023-10-09,Crayford Puregym Parking Scam to make money,"£100 parking fine for not registering my vehicle in the crayford gym. a response to a review written just 8 hours ago says ""speak to the gym manager to resolve"", but they say they can do nothing and have no relationship with the parking company. you write responses thanking customers for their feedback - just make the 2 main signs at each entrance to the car park clearer that registration is required as they do not make that clear. and how about an email and a warning in the app when you pull up your login pass?  seems this issue dates back to early 2022 as reported in a newspaper article but still going on now with the gym doing nothing to resolve. disgraceful."

1,2023-10-02,its a rubbish gym,"its a rubbish gym, racist manger is there and few pt smoke weed and they stink of it. they dont repair machines for at least over 2 months, i have had enough, you be better off in pure gym in ashton-under-line or gym-etc in stalybridge, plus all male pt go in ladies area because they are all perverts"
3,2023-10-07,Unreasonably loud,"no punchbag available and won’t be made available after request. no wi fi,  no equipment cleaning product, background music is unreasonably loud. not everyone on enjoys having their ears blasted out. other than that pretty decent if you go at a quiet time. hope this helps."
1,2023-10-07,Ive just joined this gym and at least 2…,"ive just joined this gym and at least 2 of personal trainers that work there are extremely rude, on my first day i asked one of them for help and he told me to go and ask someone else and on a different day i asked a different member of staff for help and he told he couldn’t do anything to help me!!! no one seems to be able to help in there, as there is not many personal trainers around either. i’ve always used gyms to work out and never been in a gym like this"
1,2023-10-10,Never pay a PT upfront for sessions if…,never pay a pt upfront for sessions if the billericay gym is anything to go by! they will cancel sessions an hour before and agree to pay  money back and then when you cannot rearrange will say ‘pt’s don’t have to refund’. management did nothing to help our daughter with the refund so do not trust  any pt at billericay with advance payments.
4,2023-10-06,Better than expected,"better than expected. pleased with my gym having just started. friendly staff and like minded people. very clean environment. i also like the app and scan option to get in and out. just got to remember to charge my phone fully and to bring charger with me, just in case. i am a early bird gym person, always have been with the exception of the weekend. i joined completely blind with no visit. it has been the best investment to date with my self, did weight watchers prior it worked, great results but 3 years later weight back on. what has always worked and allowed me to eat what i want is the consistency with the gym and walking. back to basics, pure gym allows this at a good price. however if there were to be increases i would need to reconsider. i will say this, noticed pure gyms vary in price. i chose the one that worked for me with the location although others would have that are cheaper it was in the opposite direction to where i needed it to be, so paying more, but no complaints so far.  showers temperature not great in ladies, luke warm at best, much more on the cooler side, also appear to have been bitten again while in studio for classes on both legs during floor exercises with classes. this is my only gripe."
2,2023-10-06,"Zero compassion customer service, unclear terms, and pricey late fees","i froze my membership one day before the direct debit was due to come out because i realised i could not afford to pay that month (cost of living crisis is hitting hard and im only on benefits due to being mentally and physically disabled). i checked to see any info saying it would take longer than that for the freeze to take place but could not see any. i was then charged £45, which is the monthly fee + £20 in late fees because the dd was unable to come out of my account. i asked for a refund since id tried my best to stop the dd coming out and since im clearly really struggling at the moment but received absolutely zero compassion or help in the reply. no empathy for a fellow human being struggling to eat now because the late fees i tried to avoid have taken me way out of budget. this has affected my mental health hugely and i cant believe there was literally zero compassion shown towards me for an honest mistake."
5,2023-10-06,Great spacious modern gym,"great spacious modern gym, staff were helpful and friendly,"
1,2023-10-04,Your website boasts free parking,"your website boasts free parking. i wrongly made the assumption this was for members and not for people using it as free workplace parking and football parking not for gym members.  fed up of queuing whilst watching people return from work to their cars, and then witness people parking and walking out to the leicester stadium for an evening match.  why why why not get anpr or are puregym that strapped for cash that they cannot support members use there free parking.  soon it won’t be worth being a member if all i’m doing is paying for people to park their cars for free and not be able to use these facilities"
4,2023-09-28,Good Gym but Restricted Car Parking,"while im happy with the gym and have been a member since it opened, ive been fined for parking in the car park at night after 11:00pm. the puregym web-site mentions that its a free car park, indicating restrictions. however, as mentioned on the car park signage, its for use by shoppers in the retail park. puregym is not a shop/retailer and ive been fined for that and also for exceeding two hours. thus its misleading of puregym to say its a free car park. i have additionally scanned a qr code in the gym to use the car park. this has made no difference. i have long-term health issues including musculoskeletal conditions and it takes me a while to warm up and cool down before exercising and that pushes me to the two hour limit at times. on top of this there are repeated messages in the gym saying that everyone is welcome. i dont find this to be true, its not inclusive, particularly if i have to park elsewhere and struggle to access the gym. puregym should be working with the landlord to address restricted parking for puregym members. i and others should not be facing fines, and i shouldnt be paying a fine.  im not sure why i should be continuing with membership, or how i can."
5,2023-10-05,Kassidy Chaplin Burn It and Step…,"kassidy chaplin burn it and step classes  really dedicated to making sure we get the most out of the class in the time that we have, really makes us work for it and we are grateful for that!  thank you for all the brilliant classes!"
3,2023-10-06,Broken equipment,been a member for a few years. would give five stars but most of the treadmill don’t switch on never mind how long you press the on button. the exercise bikes all have broken foot straps except two which are always in use at busy times. it’s sad to always see the members trying to find equipment to work.
1,2023-07-06,I’m so apsed !,"i’m so apsed !! i apply to freeze my membership,cos i was been 3 months away,and they send email is done,but when i check my online banking,they took the money 😡😡 really bad 😡😡😡😡"
4,2023-10-05,Nice gym,"nice gym, nice personal that work there atmosphere in gym when i attend is great, has good equipment but it could do with a few extra bits in there."
2,2023-10-04,Unpleasant Experience Due to Poor AC and Closing Time Policies,"the air conditioning in the gym leaves much to be desired, making workouts uncomfortable.  over the past few days, ive noticed an issue with the closing procedures. approximately 20 minutes before closing time, a staff member goes around to remind everyone of the impending closure, and 3 minutes before the official closing time the same staff member insists that everyone leave immediately. even when we politely mention that there are still a few minutes left, she remains persistent until we vacate the premises. this has made my gym experience quite unsettling and far from welcoming. unfortunately, there is no apparent means of contacting the gym manager to address these concerns, which is disappointing."
5,2023-10-05,"Convient, clean and welcoming","great range of equipment, clean and helpful staff, looking forward to trying the classes too.  great addition to the area."
3,2023-10-04,Good gym but…,"first time in london wall gym, overall experience is good, clean restrooms ( didn’t use showers) and good equipment, i just didn’t like that since the gym is underground there is no signal which leaves you completely unconnected. i would recommend to install wifi in these kind of gyms to be used by members. also from my previous experience in different puregym branches i noticed that they kept improving the gym by changing machines, i believe this gym lacks better benches since the ones they have are too tall and too complicated in comparison with other benches (matrix)."
1,2023-10-05,Car parking scam,"i would have liked to rate the gym much higher because i am really enjoying it but the car park scheme they employ is a fraud. there are big signs all around the parking area saying you have to be a member of the gym to use the car park. i have parked there 3 times since i registered only to get 3 fines. now, after calling the parking company they tell me i have to register my vehicle in the gyms tablet every time i park there and that i should have read the signs in the notice board in the gym that tell me to do so. are they kidding!  this is not acceptable and if it is not resolved (both for the fines to be lifted and for puregym to make it much clearer to everyone how the system works) i will do whatever i can to organise people against such an adverserial system and see where realy bad publicity can take us."
5,2023-10-05,Recently joined and really enjoying it,"recently joined and really enjoying it. have a great pt who is helping me to train and progress. the gym itself is an amazing space. its really big with plenty of machines, apparatus and equipment. you feel very secure there and the facilities are great for the membership price. there is an app which is also really good. would highly recommend!"
5,2023-10-03,Purgym personal trainer,"i have recently had sessions with hayley a personal trainer at the gym , and she was amazing really loves the work she does and listens to what you want to get out of the experience and tailors your plan to all your needs. i would highly recommend her if you are looking for a personal trainer, not only is she professional she is a great person."

4,2023-10-04,Decent range of equipment,"decent range of equipment. some of it showing a little wear and tear. not too busy if you use facility during off-peak times. also its cheaper, reduced membership if you can use 1200-1600 weekdays with anytime friday/sat/sunday. staff friendly and let you get on with it. parking at ml1 facility can be hit or miss. again more spaces if you go off-peak. some incentives to introduce a friend."
5,2023-10-04,WOW Excellent visit,"this was my first visit, and the gym certainly had the wow factor, staff were very friendly and the equipment first class.  the gym was clean, overall an excellent experience.  would definitely recommend this gym."
1,2023-10-03,Poor hygiene,"i am a regular member of puregym bromley, the gym equipment, staff, members are all fantastic.  the main problem with this gym is the lack of hygiene.  on a regular basis there is no soap, no paper towels, members going to the toilet and can not wash their hands then touching all the equipment.  at present there is no running water in the gym! i hope on this occasion it is a priority and is fixed asap. we have been offered other gyms to train but these do not work for some of us who travel to work in the bromley area.  there has been times when the hot water has not been fixed for over a week."
5,2023-07-08,Love this gym,"love this gym, staff are friendly and it is always spotless"
1,2023-10-04,"basic, small & too busy","pretty basic, small and mega busy all the time. been a member for 3 years and only seen about 3 pieces of new kit in that time. no reinvestment into kit, poor use of space and no consideration for membership number. £28.99 a month is over priced for this gym"
5,2023-10-03,Great classes!,"nice new gym.  wasnt overcrowded and plenty of equipment.  great body tone class yesterday with kelly - loved her encouraging, friendly approach. will definitely be back!"
5,2023-10-03,Spacious and well maintained,ive recently signed up at warrington north and found the personal trainers in attendance friendly and willing to answer questions. the gym equipment is well-maintained and spaciously placed to not feel cramped at peak times.
1,2023-09-17,Unkempt and unmaintained,"attended the pure gym in newport and it was atrocious.  the gym is much smaller than it is made to appear in photos. as well as this half of the machines were not working, neither was the yanga water dispenser. the water dispenser also looked dirty.  the gym was not at all well maintained and the atmosphere was threatening and unwelcoming"
4,2023-10-03,Nice and big with plenty of classes of offer.,"upon arrival, i was impressed by the fairly big car park, the cctv, the entrance pods and the car reg entry. i liked the size of the gym and the lockers available near the entrance which we used before our workout. i was disappointed by the loudness and littering by some of the gymgoers but i cant blame puregym for their behaviour. there were plenty of bins and cleaning stations around the gym. some equipment was well used but it all seemed safe enough, it was mainly the missing cup holders and frayed bike pedals that i noticed. the historical sports photography on the walls was a nice touch to the minimalistic decor. the cycle class was very good with the very enthusiastic and friendly instructor matthew moss. post-workout in the changing rooms, i found the showers weak and they cut out very fast which meant getting washed took me longer than i wanted after my workout. leaving through the pod was easy enough and i left feeling well worked after my cycle class but excited for the next one, i will make sure i leave a bit longer for showering next time i visit though."
1,2023-10-03,Messy Gym,"ive been a member of this gym for 2 years and its really gone downhill in that time. half your time at the gym is finding the equipment you need as people are always moving things and not putting them back. some signage telling people to put their weights back are needed. they also do not have enough equipment for the cables. they need to get more ropes and straight bars as theres never enough. its also incredibly busy, understandably this isnt something that theyd want to fix but id be checking the cctv at the entrance from 4-7 and seeing how many teenagers are entering on one account together."
3,2023-10-03,Pure Gym Need tougher rules on people who don't replace their weights!,"i find the staff to be professional and friendly but instead of the need to ""police"" the gym during busy times pure gyms head office should seek to use more visible reminders for members to be considerate and make sure they replace their weights after use. that way there would be a better culture instead of the current ""whack a mole"" approach there is at the moment. there is a small but very determined (ignorant) minority that dont put their weights away after they finish.. pure gym head office needs to address this over the tannoy instead of these incessant messages about how we are all welcome. we already know we are welcome or people of all races/ ethnicities wouldnt be there!  then there is the ""strike out harassment"" message. how many reports of harassment does pure gym get on a daily or weekly basis? how many times has someone complained of racism or exclusion from the gym based on race? as a black man that joined soho gym in 2004 and been with pure gym since it took over the site in 2018, i have never experienced any of that. meanwhile what i do experience every single day is weights being left by members who are too lazy to replace them after use. i see trip hazards by way of dumbbells and kettle bells and mats being left in the leg press and hamstring curl training area. i see people leaving loaded barbells on squat racks and have seen ladies who have to unload multiple 20kg plates off the leg press or squat rack left there by some inconsiderate member. (these are then taken off and left on the floor). i see plates leaning up against the weight racks as though lifting them onto the rack was a bridge too far for whoever left it there. all this makes your ""train safe"" message sound like a joke. repeated behaviour like this does not match your ""train safe"" message, it makes a mockery of it! your obligation as a company is to educate people to show basic levels of gym etiquette and consideration to their fellow members. i even printed off more of your miniscule notices that are hidden from view in corners of the gym. no one takes any notice of those messages so i printed 15 copies to be put in more prominent parts of the gym but was told that head office stated that only 4 posters can be allowed in the gym for fear of ""offending"" people. i couldnt believe my ears. at best this policy is a negligent lack of duty of care to your members and at worst it is a policy that displays stupidity of galactic proportions because pure gym head office prefer to use their email and media resources to remind us black people that we have a history and lgbtq and non lgbtq communities that we are all welcome in a place where we already train happily together! but you fly 2 rainbow flags and 2 large ""everybody welcome"" flags and send us black history month emails when you could easily use the same resources to educate the small but determined ignorant and inconsiderate members that leave their weights all over the place for your staff and me to put away. how does that make any sense? why not use a flag or banner as big as the current ""everybody welcome"" one to say a simple message ""please replace your weights after use. repeated failure to do this will result in pin suspension"" who could possibly get offended by a simple reminder to show basic levels of consideration to their fellow members? we really do live in very strange times! instead of treating this gym like a creche full of toddlers that may have a tantrum when politely reminded to be considerate, try leaving messages that educate this minority instead of incessantly reminding us of things we already know (""everybody is welcome""). i really do hope someone in head office reads this and uses basic common sense because this is a problem that you really need to address instead of all this ""safe place to train"" nonsense. a safe and judgement free zone? give me a break! people are being judged for their lazy inconsiderate behavior! regarding your ""safe place to train"" nonsense i can assure you ive not been bitten by any snakes or had an attempted kidnapping so yes it is a safe place to train! now try living up to your duty of care by making it a considerate place to train, you might find theres more harmony. tell us what we need to know not what we already know (that everyone is welcome and its so safe). im told there are rules in which this is mentioned. the problem is no one takes any notice so make them bigger and use more of them or announce the message over the speakers! its not rocket science is it?"
3,2023-10-03,Bad air conditioning,"the gym is good but like a lot of reviews have said in the past, the air conditioning is still really bad. i know it isnt hot weather anymore but when youre working out, getting hot, having bad air con can affect someones health. theres big fans in the main area but there isnt any at all in the female area. sometimes there is but for some reason they keep removing it? the air conditioning seems to be a big problem looking at the reviews, yet still hasnt been sorted out."
2,2023-10-01,Decent gyms,decent gyms. parking is a pain when you have to register every time. puregym need to have a facility to register your car so you dont have to register every time you park
5,2023-10-03,Excellent Gym experince,really enjoy this gym. the gym is well equipped and a great place to train.  i have seen reviews commenting on gym cleanliness. from what i have seen this is down to some members who frankly dont have the decency to clean up after themselves. there are cleaners and also the trainers are often cleaning the gym and equipment.  i do a lot of classes as well and these are always excellent.
5,2023-10-03,Get up and Go,"i’m retired so this is my get up to go place.  it’s a good price, excellent equipment and great trainers, approachable not stand offish like a lot of gyms. main thing is it’s great for mental health, i see people whereas if i sit at home i’m alone.  give it a go."
1,2023-10-02,Poor management,"gone downhill, have been going here for <5 years but now cancelled my membership due to poor cleanliness and poor management. seriously disappointed, would not recommend."
1,2023-10-03,One of the worst unreliable gym Walsall…,"one of the worst unreliable gym walsall pure gym , it’s stated 24 hours gym on paper but while reach there 3am the door won’t open , once u contact emergency line they will inform that gym won’t open for a day due to bla bla .. , they don’t even bother to inform us through mail or text . it’s happen to multiple times ( latest today 3/10/2023) , still u need to pay the car park otherwise penalties. this gym inside is very dirty always , wifi is like they using from 20years before one , management is totally unreachable. in my experience overall the worst morning nightmare. this branch is shame for pure gym franchise. i know you people won’t publish this feedback because truth always hurts isn’t . thank very much for nothing"
5,2023-10-02,PureGym (Maypole),"they lack the variety of machines which back-street/independent gyms offer, i really wish they would invest more in a wider array of equipment but they do provide the basic necessities. id enjoy it if they implemented some boxing equipment into their gyms too.  that being said, overall puregym surpasses any gym ive ever stepped foot inside. ive only been to a few of their many locations but cleanliness is never an issue, its 24/7 and has affordable membership options to suit everyone. im a core member, currently £20.99. my gym partner has a plus membership which offers additional benefits (i sometimes use his code for free yanga water 🤫😉). they even offer an off-peak membership if youd rather avoid the crowds during peak hours! and the fact its attached to a sainsburys is a bonus."
3,2023-10-02,"Great location, friendly vibes.",been coming here for years. great location and friendly vibes.  not keen on the new layout where most of the machines have moved upstairs. it’s made downstairs look even more empty.  i’ve noticed as of late… the carabiners for cable machines keep going missing. so quite often i’m having to search the gym for spare carabiners. they cant be that expensive to obtain spares?  the free weights room could do with more benches. quite a few people use benches for storing their bags but not use it for exercise? which defeats the purpose. perhaps posters advising people not to do this would be beneficial?  more cable machines would be great as they’re very popular and i often have to wait to use them.  more dipping bars would be great as there’s only 2.
5,2023-10-02,I like it here,"i like it here. there will be some people doing inexplicable exercises and the odd person doing 100 sets of hip thrusters on the smith machine -what’s that all about-, but you can ignore it and get on with your workout. friendly gym instructors, clean, good equipment. recommended."
5,2023-10-02,Amazing atmosphere. Great value,great choice of equipment and good availability for peak times. extremely friendly and helpful staff and a pleasant environment to train in. great access (24/7 opening) and excellent value for money. highly recommend!
1,2023-06-05,Shocking service,"shocking service. you cancel the membership, it doesn’t cancel, take payment, then try to cancel again but they physically make it impossible to cancel so you have to just cancel your direct debit."
5,2023-10-02,Great Gym,"arrived on a monday at 3 o’clock so gym was relatively quiet. was very clean, good temperature, lots of equipment. not sure how it will be in busy periods though, same as all other gyms i expect. nice staff too."
1,2023-05-01,Incompetent,"i joined when they first opened with an opening offer. 6 months later they started taking a much higher amount from my direct debit, many many many phone calls later, popped in 4 times (manager never there and never calls back, none of tts staff were the original staff so they didn’t know what had been on offer), all totally frustrating and on principle i cancelled my contract. only then did they admit their error. too late for me, which was a shame as it’s so close to my house"
5,2023-10-02,This is a great gym,"this is a great gym, large two tier car park, loads of floor space with very high ceiling, so plenty of space to train comfortably in, certainly the largest gym i have ever used, good selection of machines, free weights and aerobic equipment such as exercise bikes, steppers and cross trainers. really enjoyable gym experience."
1,2023-10-02,Be warned!!,be warned!!. i recently experienced a serious injury and so had to end my membership. a payment was taken from my account at the start of the month which i requested be refunded as i dont use the service. their response was that this isnt inline with their policy and that no refund would be issued. to my mind this is technically theft. be careful when dealing with them also as they have no means of contact other than email etc.
5,2023-10-02,I love puregym the trainers are really…,i love puregym the trainers are really nice the gyms clean i stopped going to the gym as i have bad health but one of the trainers asked me about it and said he would help me as he also knows i have anxiety he really has helped me because if it wasnt for him id not have signed back up to pure so thank you
1,2023-10-02,Been going to this gym for few years…,"been going to this gym for few years now and have seen the downfall of the management here, have told managers for the last few weeks that the yanga water which i pay for has no flavour as they are to lazy to refill the liquid, the male manager rudely says that i am just trying to get free drinks rather then being helpful when i am paying for this service. machines are out of order for weeks and don’t get fixed, water pressure in the showers are always low and cold water. overall bad experience since the last manager has left for the last few months"
1,2023-09-30,Rude Staff,faulty equipment is not fixed for long periods of time despite telling staff about it. changing rooms stink. assistant manager is extremely rude and not helpful at all. manager is not helpful either. staff overall is rude.
5,2023-10-02,Well stocked,"well stocked, clean and lots of space"
5,2023-10-02,Great for people with anxiety,"friendly staff, i never once feel judged or under pressure from anyone there. good space, good equipment, and gets me out the house everyday for an hour. deffo worth the money, if you struggle with anxiety and going outside, it gets me out the house for at least an hour a day and that makes me feel really good. additionally, if you do not enjoy speaking to others socially, then its really nice as you just put your headphones on and zone out."
5,2023-10-02,Hooray for this new gym!,"lovely and clean, spacious, great equipment selection, easy and free parking, friendly staff. i used to go to puregym in portishead and really missed it when i moved here. hooray for this new gym!"

4,2023-10-02,I couldn't connect to a WiFi in the gym…,i couldnt connect to a wifi in the gym as i like to listen to my own music whilst working out. it says on the website it connects to o2 automatically but the only wifi available is a staff one with a password. can anyone help please
1,2023-10-01,Awful company,"only giving 1 star as there is no option for zero. bought a day pass for my grandaughter for this gymn. she travelled 30 mins to get there and on arrival the pin number they sent her would not work so she couldnt get in. she rung the bell several times as online it said if pin doesnt work ring bell and a member of staff will let you in. after 1 hour of trying to use the pin and ringing the bell, with no staff appearing, she gave up and went home. no way to call them as when you call the number that is online an automated voice tells you that you can only make contact via social media. would advise if you are looking for a gymn do not use puregymn."
1,2023-10-01,Please fix the app and website,"omg please fix the website and the app. you operate only online and no phone customer service, so when your website and app crashes the only way to contact puregym is through facebook, twitter or email. how does that work when you have customers that do not use social media and the website and app are not working simultaneously? i cant access the email address because the web page wont even load."
1,2023-09-30,Not Safe For Shy People,"after weeks of going and only using machines i knew of, i finally built up the courage to ask a staff member how to use a hack squat machine (in case it killed me). im a very anxious person so this was a huge step for me. i thought i did everything right, i looked for a person in the uniform, i checked to make sure it was a quick question that could be done throughout someones rest set, id heard this guy talk about how much money he was making so didnt think he would mind much. i stumble out ""hey sorry could you help me really quickly"" and he looks at me like im scum of the earth, his client told him i was just asking for help. he asks very aggressively ""what kind of help do you need with that? (not in the ""ill help you"" way but in the ""how could you not understand this you idiot"" way) . at this point, im shaking and almost crying and he tells me that hes not actually on shift, just wearing the uniform?? i suddenly realise that my 2 seconds of a quick guide to not injuring myself was such a terrible waste of his time and ran to the other floor. xcite would never treat me like this. this was truly an awful experience."
2,2023-10-01,Inconsiderate members,"i use this gym 4 times a week and although the staff seem nice, some of the other members have no consideration. ive watched people leave their weights on a barbell and move on to another station, put weights in the wrong place and leave stuff at equipment so that no one takes it, even if they arent using it. this week someone set up their phone on the barbells and went live on instagram - whats that all about? fair enough if you want to video yourself but dont set it up in a communal area where other people are also going to be videoed. i wish staff could enforce some rules around all of this because its a disgrace"
4,2023-10-01,Good gym - well equipped.,"good gym, lots of equipment, two floors, including classes, which i dont attend, however i see they can get popular for people who enjoy them.  i like the gym because its pretty spacious, and has all the equipment i need for a great workout."

1,2023-09-01,Yanga water not working,"paying off the month access with yanga water, but it still out of order for more than 3 weeks. it is not appropriate in this case of paying and not get full refund. please take care of it."
5,2023-08-05,Great gym,"great gym, i joined a couple of months back and so glad i did! the staff are friendly and nothing is too much of an ask! gym classes are amazing and really upbeat! worth every penny"
4,2023-09-29,Great value for money,the value for money is exceptional. 24/ 7 and a good variety of machinery and free weights. plenty of space to work out so you dont feel over crowded. would recommend to anyone looking for a well priced well equipped gym
5,2023-09-30,"Maximizing Fitness, Minimizing Costs: Why PureGym is Your Best Value!","i believe that the reasonably priced puregym offers the best value for money in a market with multiple competing no-contract gyms because it allows me to focus on my fitness goals without the frills and unnecessary costs, ensuring my hard-earned money goes directly towards my health and well-being. my only doubt is about parking. recent rises in parking charges mean that my monthly parking bill is about 150% of my gym membership fee. i appreciate this situation has not been created by puregym."
2,2023-09-30,"Good gym equipment, very inconsistent hot water, do I have to pay extra for hot shower as well??","good space, good gym equipment, i wont complain about the toilet use bc thats hard to control when you have hundreds of god-knows-who people flocking in everyday. but why is the hot water so inconsistent? i paid for the membership that includes the shower and often gets cold water, or if im lucky, a stream of warm water followed by cold water. do i have to pay for a hot water hours as well???? its seriously annoying"
1,2023-09-29,Was taking a shower walking back to my…,was taking a shower walking back to my locker and a female member of staff just walked into the mens changing room un announced no apology. if a male member of staff had done that in a female changing  room they would lose their job or be reprimanded.  every fifteen minutes we are constantly reminded on the speakers of company fire & safety policy yet they cannot train their staff to ask if people are clothed before entering into a changing room. trust pilot is my only way to make my feelings heard as pure gym have no complaints department on their website. the gym is good but the protocol training is none existent .
5,2023-09-30,Great Gym at competitive cost,"in andover there is a good quantity and quality of equipment with most being available when needed, all at a competitive monthly cost. it would be even better if the cleaning station on the first floor was repaired and was more regularly restocked - too many times it is either out of paper or cleaning solution"
1,2023-09-30,Extremely rude and unprofessional management,"i raised a concern with the management via email and the response i received was rude, unprofessional, and didnt even make sense."
5,2023-09-28,5 Star Gym and Classes,"pure gym ravenswood ipswich is by far the best in town. it’s exceptionally clean and is equipped with all machines, weights, dumbbells etcthe classes are fantastic, all fitness instructors liam, shannon p, hannah, stuart, chris and the managers reuben and shannon are very kind, friendly and approachable, they are there to help you and nothing is too much trouble .. i have found that after a busy stressful week the ‘meditation’ class held by liam on fridays  at 6pm really helps you to unwind and set you up for the weekend and following week ahead  a sort of ‘me’ time … why not give yourself 30 minutes of peace and relaxing after all you deserve it .... it’s suitable for everyone male and female so, if you have thought about it, wondering what it’s about or just curious .. why not come an join us and see for yourself … it’s time you put yourself and your well-being first …"

2,2023-09-29,Grubby,"possibly the untidiest, most poorly equipped puregym i have ever been to.  weights all over the place and not put back. grubby equipment and benches. the place also looks like it needs a nap its that tired.  the manager wasnt particularly helpful, and seemed more interested in chatting to the personal trainer than helping me out on my first visit there.  i will rather be driving into the urban exchange gym that i usually go to even though i live in ashton."
5,2023-09-29,Massive Thanks to PhilChester *…,"massive thanks to philchester * assistant manager * he understood my needs and pointed me in the right direction and match me to a pt. your kindness and understanding towards myself were top quality today, and for this, i thank you x 😊"

1,2023-09-28,Is it just the male changing rooms that…,is it just the male changing rooms that don’t have showers? or are the female and disabled ones also in the same state?  feels quite discriminatory.
5,2023-09-26,Under new management,"under new management,  the managers chris & jo seem to be doing a great job at walton, both very welcoming when you arrive or leave and they are both very friendly and approachable people. they both also know their stuff so any questions you need answering they are always on hand to help you. i always see jo mucking in with the team and getting stuff done even with the cleaning she get in and dose it too.  she is very helpful and chatty too."
1,2023-09-28,Trainer no show,"i’ve not been to a gym for 20+ years so thought that before i do anything, i’d book myself on an induction/getting started session.  booking the induction in the app was easy and i received an email as follows:  “youre booked onto your get started session on the 28/09/23 at 16:00; youll be met by me, anthony, in the entrance of the gym (outside the pods). i will be in a teal top, and ill be there a little early to meet you when you arrive.”  i arrived a bit early at 1545 to use the toilets. i quite clearly looked lost trying to find the toilets because i hadn’t been here before. no member of staff approached me to ask if i was ok.  i found the toilets and then returned to the foyer/entrance to the gym “outside the pods”. i was there about 1550. by 1600, nobody in a teal top was anywhere to be seen. as such i went inside and waited for a further 10 minutes. staff members walked past and blanked me. nobody asked if i was ok, not so much as a smile.  by 1610 i just left. i’ll be changing my home gym to somewhere else where hopefully the staff will be a little more friendly.  update in response to pure gyms reply:  there is sufficient detail including my name, date, time and location for you to be able to deal with the issue from here. you’ll see me on the cctv. i can’t give any more information. i was considering changing the home gym, but i decided against it and just cancelled my membership today."
1,2023-09-28,Disappointed,"disappointed. ive been going to this gym for years and have always enjoyed my own workout space, plenty of room and doesnt feel like its over crowded. all the machines have moved upstairs making it now feel the opposite of this. i try to go on a back machine and ive got now groups of lads standing around and over me. im 46 years young and this makes me feel really intimidated which i never would feel like in this gym! in the process of looking for another."
1,2023-09-28,Things are getting worse,"things are getting worse since i left my last review. hand dryer in mens changing rooms - it has been out of use for 3-4 weeks maybe longer.  i was training legs and wanted to do calf press - this machine is out of action, so then i went to leg press machine near it to do it on there, also out of action!!! it seems like management do not have the resources to fix things - i pay good money to use the facilities but its not fair that machines are out of action or things dont get fixed quickly.  unfortunately, if the situation does not improve soon, i will have to look at alternative gyms in ipswich."

2,2023-09-28,Male changing room - not fit for purpose.,"been a member for sometime now, before joining andover gym, i did research and read the reviews of which there seemed to be only one consistent and major complaint - the male changing room facilities and primarily the showers. the changing room constantly wreaks of urine and the showers just simply don’t work. i’ve had one hot / warm shower in over 6 months while attending the gym approximately 4 times per week. complaining to the ever rotating staff is utterly pointless as they simply don’t want to hear it anymore as they’re simply ignored by management, of which they freely admit don’t give a toss. management are a disgrace, never seen any regional or above personnel visit the gym, it simply operates on a pay your money, we don’t care basis. it’s a well supported and busy gym but the disdain of which users are treated or considered is unacceptable. if there was a relatively similar alternative i’d be off in a shot, which is similar opinion held by the majority of users. on the basis of the above i can only rate the gym / company 3-10. note. the response below by pure is comical, no surprise they clearly have not read my review with any seriousness.. and is as i expected. say what you like about your intent etc.. the reality is at andover..the showers do not work and the changing rooms stinks of urine."
1,2023-09-28,"Broken equipment, terrible member service","following complaint on 21 sep....yet another week and the stepper is still broken. no update, no feedback"
5,2023-09-12,Team Support,"i want to thank the pts and manager who supported me when i had a seizure. the pts who were there at the time could not have supported me the way they did and promptly followed procedure. after the incident, i have been checked on, all have been gentle, mindful, and caring. much gratitude to the amazing team! x"

5,2023-09-26,Foad classes,i have always been nervous about attending a class but decided to take the plunge today. to say i was surprised is an understatement! i attended the strength class run by foad and it was really good. he could see it was my first time and really went out of his way to make me feel at ease. the class was hard but that is what i wanted and foad knew exactly when to push everyone. he is a real asset to the gym and i will certainly be taking more classes now.

2,2023-09-26,What’s with the new layout?,"what’s with the new layout? the gym has went downhill over many months, broken machines, lack of tidying, cleaning etc.  new layout change is awful, hopefully only temporary. icing on the cake of a good gym gone bad. disappointing."

3,2023-09-04,Does not take responsibility for own's staff mistake.,"the company does not take ownership of mistakes done by their own staff. not taking responsibility does not support trusting a service provider. i incurred travel costs which would have been avoided if they did not do the mistake in the first place and refuse to acknowledge it and provide reimbursement. only trying to sell more memberships or upgrades. its a shame theres such a bad customer services as the facilities are somewhat nice/decent for the price. edit since reply: i already emailed the customer service for this issue, hence the ""trying to sell more"". edit 2 since further exchanges with co. representative: it feels the review here changed something in the way they were initially handling the situation, as ive had a partial reimbursement of the expenses incurred."

4,2023-09-25,Bike storage needed,what you expect from a puregym and nice and quiet in the morning. dont use the changing rooms or showers so cant comment on those. one major improvement needed is a bike storage solution - this gym has loads of space in the foyer but nowhere to safely secure bikes.

5,2023-09-19,Strength 30,i had the pleasure to attend foad’s strength 30 class over a year ago at a friend suggestion. his attention to our form and how he made us push hard was one of the reasons why i began my journey for increasing my muscle mass in the first place. the class has an authentic vibe - the music is perfect for the type of exercises and you can tell that everyone is giving their all so you automatically start giving your well too. what i can say is that this class has been running for a long time and it has been fully booked every week. his dedication and drive to help everyone get in shape are a few out of many reasons why people love this class!
5,2023-09-24,Great experience highly recommended,i have been a member of the gym for the last couple of months now and would highly recommend it.  it’s open 24 hours always clean and tidy and lots of equipment to choose from.  i would highly recommend you try strength 45 with foad he certainly knows his stuff and ensures all participants know how to get the best out of the class and spends time with all participants on a one on one basis making everyone feel included and welcome
1,2023-09-24,This is shocking service ...i am from…,"this is shocking service ...i am from essex and have a £30 nationwide membership at pure gym ..i have had this nationwide mem ership for at least 4 years . i have just tried to visit the puregym in witney as i have done many times over the last 4 years , but i now cannot gain access to this gym ..the message says my (membership does not cover me for this gym ) this gym is no longer on the list.. i was always before able to use this witney gym and i have been witney gym ..now witney has been removed and i cannot use it ...existing customers who use other gyms should absolutey be able to continue using a facility that was available when they joined the national membership .. service and consideration to its clients has become awful...to add to this i have had quite a few fines in billericay gym car park (my home gym) ..the fines i had were for either forgetting to sign in on the login machine or the machine not logging my number plate properly im not sure but ..several time i have proven to smart charging ( the car park owners) that i was at the gym during those hours but they still dont cancel the fine ...and all pure gym say is its not our problem and wash their hands of the it..there are so many people complaining about this parking at billericay .. ..surely puregym have some duty to their clients to try and sort this out ...i have been a loyal member or 5 years and they really dont give a damn...i will be cancelling my membership forever"
5,2023-09-19,Strength30,"i’ve been attending gym classes for more than 1 year and all my friends are shocked when they hear me say i’m looking forward to them. a positive and motivating trainer can make a significant difference in how much you enjoy your workouts!  foad is putting a lot of effort into ensuring the classes have different exercises to target various muscle groups and prevent boredom and that people have a correct form throughout the session. the classes have a great atmosphere (and music) and lots of people are attending, creating a sense of community and support which keeps us all engaged. constant full attendance is testament to how much people enjoy his class. thanks for encouraging us to be more active and making class more enjoyable!"
1,2023-09-13,The gym has gone down hill,"the gym has down hill but increased the fees , it sad to say but the whole experience of this gym has gone downhill since lockdown. before lockdown the change of management and the majority of the instructors  the classes used to be pretty good -fully of energy and most of the time the classes were full ! most of the classes now  as i haven’t been to all are  the same-ish although they call the classes a different name , (pump, body tone , lbt..) these class are ok but not so inspiring and can be repetitive ,at times  boring . they use to have a great spin instructor on a tuesday and wednesday evening (monday spin )class was always fully booked )….the instructor had good energy and motivation , changed her playlist and routines , which made her class fresh and inspiring to want to go every week  .the step class with her was also pretty good .. bootcamp at pure gym which is ok  it is what it says it is - (haven’t been to all classes / instructors due to the time…) ….needs to be revamped more energetic,  and move with the times .aerobic type class like body attack, or kettlebell class .. maybe a step class again …  , again with the price increase we shouldn’t have to pay for additional classes like yoga, and i think i saw zumba on the timetable for about a week . but the last instructor  looked as is she was just dancing on her own in front of her bedroom mirror, and wasn’t  really teaching .the ladies only section - again is dead !!needs upgrading  it needs a smith machine . chest press , leg press .. women are getting stronger , they don’t just want boring ab machine from back in the 80s and the other machine next to it . that whole wall of equipment should be thrown away . and  possibly could fit a smith machine where the mats are . get rid of the power plate machine .who uses it ???  take away maybe one of the bikes and add a leg/hamstring press machine. ..  get some good air con - as it gets hot and stuffy in there too ....and to top it off every time you enter the main entrance of the gym it sinks!!"
1,2023-09-22,Do NOT trust PureGym,"we the members are getting frustrated and fed up with the lack of action with the men’s showers specifically failing to repair and failing to clean them. this is firmly with pure gym hq and team… we have complained in the gym, we have raised concerns about the green mould and smell. we have written reviews and we have contacted the gym directors in leeds. every single request has been ignored.  we have taken samples of the mould this evening and sent them to environmental health."

5,2023-09-23,Great experience at Pure Altrincham,"i’ve been a member just under a year now and i couldn’t be happier with pure altrincham. staff are brilliant, friendly, supportive and take time to get to know you. special praise and gratitude to dolla, james, eve and dec. huge range of classes through the week and overall brilliant value for money. wouldn’t want to go anywhere else - thanks!!  a separate note to pure hq, some of the equipment is getting tired now and needs investment and replacement. spin bikes especially- at the time of writing there’s about 3 out of action and faults are common. the staff do their best with what they have but they can only do so much!"
5,2023-09-22,Ladies section!!!,ladies section!!!! just wow. this review is specifically for saint georges way in leicester ( not sure of other pure gyms) when i started this gym there was no section just for ladies and i was not comfortable using weights as it was highly dominated by the men however now they have made a section for ladies only and its fairly big - has all the equipment and an area to get changed. i love it! im more confident and super comfortable now.
5,2023-08-18,Godfray- one of the best :)),"gym-well equipped and friendly, but whats best abaut it is an exceptional personal trainer- godfray. he is one of the best personal trainers i have ever met. he is an amazing young man with great knowledge, passion and a unique approach to the client. he loves what he does and can inspire everyone. with him every training session is an adventure and ends too quickly ;) he is very client-focused, perfectly adapting the workout to clients expectations and capabilities, very skillfully and constantly raising the bar. in addition, godfray has the unique ability to establish a special relationship with the client. he has an incredible sense of humour which definitely helps you overcome your weaknesses and achieve intended goals. meeting him is sheer enjoyment. im always exhausted but happy because thanks to him i do what is best for me. i love it :). i 100% recommend"
1,2023-09-22,Garbage,garbage. moved to this gym cuz other one had no parking. the parking is ridiculous here and unsafe first off. secondly the company that deals with the parking are a nightmare to deal with!! they’ll take anything off you even after you used the voucher the gym gives. my case has gone one since may and now had to give up and pay £170 cuz the machine didn’t work. gym staff are useless like their class sessions. manager classless. office guys make the big decisions to move gyms so their also fools. garbage gym absolute horrendous.
5,2023-09-20,Kellie is a star,"i have always struggled having the motivation to go to the gym, but after going to kellies classes i have found that you can have a laugh, and actually enjoy exercise. kellie is an asset to pure gym and cares about every one of her members. her motivation of infectious and the only reason i actually turn up and dont make excuses!! thank you!!!"
5,2023-09-20,Would recommend Pure Gym,"would recommend pure gym, staff very welcoming, plenty of classes to choose from.  pt kellie jones, pushes all who attend her classes which are tough, you feel the benefits the next day....... classes never get any easier, despite kellie saying there easy."
5,2023-09-22,Max Ramirez PT,"i cannot speak highly enough of max ramirez pt.  after some health complications—i knew it was time to make some lifestyle changes, the gym being one of them. i had never stepped foot in a gym so i sought out a pt as i would’ve had little to no idea what i was doing.  max worked with me over the next three months. his professionalism, dedication and attention to detail was of the highest degree. not only did this involve putting together detailed workout plans, but also bringing me in for sessions to ensure that technique and form were on correct.  after three months of working with a max i noticed considerable changes in strength, weight and body fat %. even more importantly imo i parted ways with max with a more positive mindset with regards to the gym and achieving my goals."

5,2023-09-22,I've been a member for a few years but…,"ive been a member for a few years but started training with kellie once a week around 12 months ago. i cant rate her highly enough. its not just a one-hour workout - kellie checks in throughout the week, gives meal prep suggestions, workouts to do at home, and is genuinely invested in helping you achieve results. the range of equipment and facilities are excellent for the membership price, and classes always seem popular."
2,2023-09-18,Inputting registration,inputting registration as most people forget to enter their registration as they just want to work out straight away just like the other day how i got a parking fine for only being 50 mins at the gym on the one time i forgot my registration
3,2023-09-18,Puregym edgware,dont like how only two of the women clean the gym .. like classes held there no air con running properly in the ladies only area and ladies toilets as well as the terrible sewage like scent on a daily basis only a few of the staff conduct themselves in a professional manner

4,2023-09-19,Perfect  location.,"the location is the best thing about this gym for me personally.  there is usually issues with weight machine availability, there is only one of each with a few exceptions.  it is incredibly hot inside, the air con is woefully inadequate.  the female cleaner that is constantly wondering round the male changing rooms is also an irritation.  some customer wi-fi would be nice too (customer wi-fi now available) 😉  edit: the only hand dryer in the male changing room has been broken now for over a month (hand dryer now fixed) & it’s still too warm in the gym"
5,2023-09-18,Great gym and great location plenty of…,great gym and great location plenty of parking outside makes it so convenient! plenty of machines and equipment for you to have a great workout. a wide range of choice of classes also to take advantage of. pt and instructor kellie is a great asset to puregym brunswick. she will always make time to help advise even during class if youre getting it wrong she will make sure you do get ot right. love her spin cycles they are a must each week and leg bums and tums. thank you kellie for always being encouraging

5,2023-09-21,2 Years and love it!,"after going to several gyms in liverpool brunswick was my favorite.  my personal trainer kellie helped me not only train, lose weight, and get stronger but also gave me great mental help during a trying time in my life.  strongly recommend! would only note as a minus that some of the classes have really loud volume."
3,2023-09-01,the ladies room is a plus,"i like the ladies room, so you don’t have to be stared at or intimidate by all the guys in the gym. i will say some of the equipment in the ladies area are a bit “beaten up” but they still work so that’s what matters. there’s a lot of equipment in general and workout options too.  one of the downsides to the gym is their staff, quite rude and lacking customer service skills. that’s one thing the gym is doing better at. anyone with common sense knows how hard it is for people to feel encouraged and motivated to go to the gym and the staff just make you want to cancel your subscription.  on top of that, their worst downside is their classes, while there’s plenty to book, the classes are not beginner friendly and the trainers leading these classes don’t care to check in with everyone’s level. my first class was cycling and i felt like i was racing lance armstrong, and injured my calf. so i tried something different this week and did a hiit class on monday, it’s now thursday and i can barely walk. safe to say i won’t participate in any lessons and it’s a shame as the program looks decent and i’ve been gyming and working out for a few years now… imagine!"
3,2023-09-21,Lady’s toilet is a constant of male…,lady’s toilet is a constant of male members coming in even when there is female members working at the same time. the lady’s toilet have got a fire exit which leads to other doors for staff and i see using that door in the lady’s like a corredor to go to other places. totally not private enough to be there getting ready to have a shower.

1,2023-09-20,The new layout is horrendous,"the new layout is horrendous, anyone wanting to do cardio, find an alternative gym. all crammed together in the corner, all machines right next to one another, never any spaces, running machines facing walls 30 cm from your face. suggest the layout plans are changed. will not be continuing my membership."
3,2023-09-20,Generally a good gym and good value .,"generally a good gym and good value . however- air con is never on, maybe to save money during the high energy costs, but either way its boiling hot during the summer. also machines are quite old, and when one is broken its broken for months. eg pull up machine was out for ages and the seat on the diverging row machine has been broken for as long as i can remember."
3,2023-09-19,Good Value but dirty,"good value for money but still comes with more faults than the value for money. aircon rarley works and with the surronding windows its like a greenhouse. when aircon is switched on there is so many leaks its like a workout navigating the numerous buckets on the floor. gym smell sweaty and damp. changing rooms are very dirty with left over items under benches amd lockers, showers are rearlly cleaned with then flooding due to blocked drains or plugholes with no equipment or squiqqiges or mops for gym goers to use to clean the floor before use.  water machine has been broken last few days and along with that also the yanga machine. one small water dispenser on the side nearby which has been empty on more occassions.  the gym reguallry under goes refurb, following this layout always changed and machine move closer together making it more cramped.  free weights section is very small and cramped. with no proper ventilation causing bo smell to worse. eveyday.  staff are friendly enough and are approachable."

1,2023-09-19,To Rebecca Passmore and UK PureGym HQ team,"puregym management i.e rebecca passmore and your uk team, support this gym fix the problems that members report….. no generic response about sorry it’s 1 star, or contact gym manager…. it’s clear that they don’t have the resources or approval for the cost to fix these problems (which isn’t their fault)…… you have increased cost of gym membership yet you cannot provide a clean, safe, enjoyable place for a workout.  list of things to resolve as a priority  - mens showers - fix all showers, remove the mould, smell and fix the water pressure - clean the gym better - dust everywhere - police the car parking use anpr if required - fix the many machines that are constantly break   also on a side note, the other puregym in leicester is looking great, well kept, invested in. replicate this at walnut street. doing the above and giving it a lick of paint and update it. might actually make members feel they are getting value for moneys"

1,2023-09-17,The gym manager has an appalling…,"the gym manager has an appalling attitude members, rude, aggressive and abrupt. its a shame because the gym has good equipment and the personal trainers are friendly enough. i have trained in gyms over 20 years, never been spoken to like that. due to this shockingly poor customer service i have no option to cancel my membership. i did put a complaint in, heard nothing back, which say it al really."
2,2023-09-11,You’ll struggle to find plates,"firstly i have to say how clean the gym is which is expected becasue it’s very new. i like how it’s big and open it is.  you will struggle to find plates. i wasted my time walking around trying to find 5kg and 10kg plate. then when benching people would just come over and take them.  the benches have no safety bars so if you bail, it’s going to be a struggle. they tell you there are safety bars but the sit far too high for bench press.  i suppose you get what you pay for, that’s why its a cheap gym."
1,2023-09-18,Unprofessional trainer,"i am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the behavior of one of your personal trainers, foad, during my recent class at your gym/studio.  today, i attended a class led by foad, scheduled to start at 9am. however, to my disappointment, foad left the room shortly after the class began and chose to prioritize a personal training client instead of teaching the class. this not only disrupted the class but also displayed a lack of professionalism and commitment to the participants.  as a paying member of your gym, i believe it is essential that instructors, like foad, fulfill their responsibilities and commitments to their students. this incident has left me feeling frustrated and disappointed with the level of service provided.  i kindly request that you address this matter promptly to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future, as they affect the overall quality of the experience for members like myself. i hope for a resolution that ensures better accountability and professionalism from your staff.  thank you for your attention to this issue, and i look forward to your response and actions to rectify the situation."

3,2023-09-16,Decent gym but it’s pricey,"gyms clean and welcoming. equipment feels minimal. curl bar for example…only 1, yet it’s increasingly popular. machines like incline chest press and tricep press, but i understand it’s space dependent. prices seem steep too, £25.99 for a working class town when puregym in central london are £27.99, seems like more than property rent inflating this price. i’d expect it to be more competitive when the local leisure centre gym is only £15 a month. overall it’s a good gym, but could be better."

5,2023-09-14,All good.,"uncrowded, clean and able to achieve what i wanted."
2,2023-09-09,Frustrating most times I visit,"this gym really needs to address the phone zombies who spend more time staring into their phones instead of concentrating on their workout.  several times i’ve asked someone if they were nearly finished after waiting ages. they said another rep and go back to their phone. 10 minutes later i just left without finishing my set as they were still sat there on the phone.  this frustration is shared by many members who just want to get their sets done and go but they’re constantly held up while people watch videos.  puregym needs to address this growing problem by placing posters asking people to not use phones while on the equipment and be mindful of other users. before long frustration will boil over into bigger problems!  also, flickering lights and showers that smell like a urinal isn’t good either!"
4,2023-09-14,Cold showers,great gym and good equipment. would like cleaning stations not only for infection control but also to clean sweaty equipment. showers far to cold and so are the changing rooms. not sure if i would stay over the winter for this reason.

4,2023-09-15,TVs behind exercise machines!,"i like pure gym, it has good equipment and it’s safe and clean. just one niggle, during the refurbishment most of the treadmills and cross trainers have been positioned so they face a blank wall instead of the 4 screens on the wall behind! annoying and baffling."
1,2023-09-14,Pure Gym HQ - please give your support to this gym manager,"pure gym hq - please support this gym manager and deputy manager fix the showers.  more and more members are becoming unhappy about this situation (and also fed up of waiting for a working shower to be available, often being late for work).  surely it’s not they hard to get a maintenance team in or a plumber? you’ve managed to refit the other leicester gym. but this one you cannot even provide a cleaner and a team to fix all the showers."
2,2023-09-14,"Broken lockers , lack of staff.",over half the lockers in the men’s changing room are broken. the toilets ( there’s only 2) in men’s changing room are very dirty and bad smelling. and there was no wi-fi available. a very basic gym and lots of broken equipment and lack of staff to make complaints or ask questions. a reception would make a huge difference during the day. very average but for the price it is fair. but  there are better gyms in the city. hope the lockers are addressed and hygiene in changing area’s improve.
1,2023-09-08,Had to cancel my membership after just…,"had to cancel my membership after just 1 week, this is not a gym it’s more like a school playground , kids running around , play fighting messing about chasing each other , zero gym etiquette at all and nothing said by staff not for me .. gym group just up the road much better"
1,2023-09-11,Customer service is non existent,"customer service is non existent. the gym is ok but there’s no way of contacting the central organisation when there are account errors or erroneous communications received. it’s disappointing as the lack of customer service is why i’m looking at alternatives. it’s ridiculous to run such a large organisation while pushing away the customer to avoid contact. also means that when they make mistakes on membership/account issues, you can’t use the facilities or resolve the problem so they’re taking money and not providing the product because they’ve messed something up."
2,2023-09-13,Unhygienic / Dirty,"thank you for the generic response. i think you are missing the point, why cant the cleaning station by the free weights be moved closer to the cardio equipment more importantly why cant it be stocked. i beg to differ about the equipment being cleaned, if you mean with a feather duster yes orherwise an emphatic no. this is the second time puregym have been less than helpfull or understanding..... time to move to a gym who care about their customers not just the money they can get from them. can only speak for longbridge gym - dirty, cleaning station close to treadmills removed, one by free weights, otherwise of gym left there. cleaning stuff from upper cardio removed, now have to go to studio to collect stuff to clean machine, management said its because of cutting back on waste. hence cardiac equipment very rarely gets wiped down after use."
1,2023-09-13,Limited kit and Uninterested staff,"visited the site today and was not impressed, limited kit and uninterested staff- found it laughable during my session with the “manager” crumpling paper and throwing it like a basketball at the bin was just as funny when finishing my session and heading up to the shower he was more interested in watching tiktok than doing anything else. i’d almost guarantee that there was better more productive things he could of been doing.  don’t get me wrong gym was clean enough- now i know puregym are taking away the cleaning stations but to have none and not have someone cleaning the kit down has made me fee uncomfortable about this and many other sites. showers could of done with a decent clean."
1,2023-09-13,Please sort your showers out,if you sort the showers out ill give you 5 stars! but the ice cold showers and the stench coming from the sinks is a real issue. please sort it because i like everything else about the gym! ps. showers are regularly an issue...this isnt new
1,2023-09-11,Still no change here,still no change here. pg seem to just copy and paste responses to silence negative customer feedback. spin bikes need maintenance work and class availability needs to be reviewed. are these not standard practices for running a gym?
5,2023-07-03,Overall great,the facility and the equipment received was great. the staff was respectful and helpful. the environment felt safe to work out in.
1,2023-09-11,Where is the gym managers,"where is the gym managers? the showers have been out of use for months, apart from 2 dirty ones that are also broken (at least usable). never cleaned. there is no communication on this issue or presence from gym management. please own this issue? or is this gym closing down ?"
1,2023-09-12,Not worth it for the price,"the gym needs more equipment. the heaviest dumbbell is 16kg which is mind blowing and to make it worse there’s no barbells, weighted plates or even a bench press. for £38, the gym is way below par."
3,2023-09-07,Been coming here since January and I…,"been coming here since january and i don’t have much to complain about. i’ve heard this location is better than most in terms of equipment, unfortunately it seems word has spread so the gym has become more popular but that’s not in anyone’s control, and there are still quiet days. in the past few weeks i am sad to say that the general & cleaning staff haven’t been as great. i never see cleaning staff no matter the time of day or week i am there, and there are no facilities to clean the equipment yourself so when a situation arises like today where a member used an apparatus and left it completely covered in sweat, it isn’t useable of course this comes with a host of problems. a week ago i spilled my water and tried to clean it with some tissue to no avail, so i told the only member of staff on duty and he just said “oh i don’t know what to do, if you can find a cleaner that would be great i’m not sure where there is one”. anyone that knows this gym knows it’s not big enough to lose another staff member in, and as the one supervising the gym i thought surely they would know if a cleaner is in at the time or not? i saw him wandering around for about an hour and considering i spilt the water within the first minute of getting in, it was only when i had finished my workout, got changed and was heading out the door that i was asked by said staff member if that was the water i had told him about, to which he then said he will put a sign out or something…i’m not sure why it took him over an hour to do this as i could’ve told this man how to handle the situation from start to finish.  overall i have a level of concern for the hygiene/cleanliness and safety of the gym at the moment as no one seems to be proactive enough in supervising the gym and ensuring the days run smoothly on their shifts."
1,2023-09-12,Overcrowded..,"overcrowded... very good gym, but you cant use any equipment. they have taken far too many members."
2,2023-09-11,Spin bikes,"spin bikes are long overdue for a service, seats at odd angles, straps are loose, speedometer rarely works. please look into this asap!"
1,2023-09-12,Avoid,"small, dirty, ridiculously loud.  attended at a non-peak time and yet still could not find more than 1 free piece of weight equipment.  changing rooms smelt, drains definitely need looking at. broken lockers, main changing room door didn’t even shut properly.  music from a spin class was so loud people in the main gym had to shout at each other and i couldn’t hear my own music on max through head phones.  luckily i’m only here visiting as in the area for a few days. would be cancelling my membership if this was my local puregym.  will not be back."
2,2023-09-12,Management should monitor the lockers…,"the staff should monitor the lockers being used as people are now leaving their stuff in the lockers preventing other people to use it. i normally go to the gym at 6am and all the lockers are full while the gym is almost empty. it is so ridiculous and disrespectful to the other members.  on the website it says that it is against the rules to keep the stuff in lockers overnight, but the management of ilford puregym is clearly not monitoring it."
1,2023-09-12,Staff taking photos of customers!,what a disgrace of a gym! the cleaner at 1:15am taking photos whilst im on the treadmill! shouldnt be taking any photos whilst people are around!!
5,2023-09-11,"If you read one review, let it be this…","if you take one review literally from this website, let it be this one and sign up with max cooper for pt sessions. i originally found max on the puregym website and although at first nervous and hesitant, i decided to book with him as he was the pt closest in age and aligned with the goals i was looking forward to make in the gym. as i had little/no gym experience, he was there for me every step of the way - making sure i felt comfortable and in a safe space learning about the gym when i was under his presence. he took his time and patience with me ensuring i was taking all of his long-standing knowledge on board. but aside from the gym, he was a genuine friend to me and supported me through all the tough times i was having and was a truly friendly face i could talk to about absolutely anything going on in my life. he’s an amazing guy and i can guarantee first hand from my experience he will nurture you towards your goals and ultimately become a great friend to you along the way."
1,2023-09-11,Puregym Northwich has to be the worst…,puregym northwich has to be the worst gym i’ve ever been in 35 years of training !!!! machines are always broke dirt and grim everywhere people not training and on there phone only to be told by management they will do nothing dirty looks from staff my girlfriend who was called “ a f—cking moron by a pt for just training !!!! i reported it nothing backing back yet at least 30 people have had the same dirty looks and abuse of this pt my girlfriend has competed in the bnbf natural bodybuilding and come 2 nd overall and is in the british finals not even a well done from no one well apart from one pt surly this makes the gym look good very very poor management but everyone says that at the gym they turn of air con when red hot outside !!! constant smells the worst music i’ve ever heard terrible rust and caps missing on allot of equipment which was reported 3 years ago !!!! still not fixed i would give it zero if i could poor management and poor attitudes off allot of pts yet warrington and the new one at crewe great atmosphere great music and vibe too pts and zero dirty looks . zero at northwich needs a total overhaul immediately iam affraid but strangely enough you cannot go above the management at puregym northwich no contact number no email !!!!
2,2023-09-11,When I chose to join puregym Muswell…,"when i chose to join puregym muswell hill, it was firstly and the main reason and still is the classes. the pts were very good and knowledgeable and made the classes enjoyable so much so that i was able to see the results of my hard work from the classes(im not that disciplined enough to train on my own) the problem is and has constantly been consistency of the classes and pts, i was doing 4  sometimes 5 or 6 classes a week 4 of them were after work monday to friday. as of today there is only 1 i can make (from the classes i did)and the pts of the classes when they was on, were not around long before they left. the others have either been stopped (due to no pt to take it) or the time has moved and im unable to attend. and as for the management well the latest manager (i dont actually know her name) stormed into the class before it started and told a client to go and put her coat in a locker as its a trip hazard which was fair enough but the way she said it well put it this way her people skills need a bit of working on.and iv never known a manager that doesnt actually take a class either.all iv seen since she has been the manager is puregym lose good pts and classes disappearing."
3,2023-04-20,Decent but these PTs,"gyms decent however the manager was doing a spin wheel raffle game , i won a free pt session, the pt trainer that contacted me i found him very arrogant so was reluctant to do anything with him. next minute he turned round and said pt ain’t free i said but i won a free session from your manager but you want to charge me. yeah that just put me off completely, ain’t been back since."
1,2023-09-08,Cool Your Boots...and Everything Else!,"i moved here when my previous gym closed following complaints (im led to believe, although the manager always maintained i was the only one with a problem).  ive only been once and it was just for a shower. the water was luke warm. i mentioned in a feedback email and am advised the showers are at 33° to reduce energy consumption. this is despite the recommendation from dermatologists that the ideal temperature is 37° or so, with an upper level of 40°.  i have no way of knowing how warm it was, but on a sunny day, the unheated water at home is a comparable temperature, cos the sun hits my kitchen and bathroom.  i think i prefer a few degrees warmer...at least another 5-10°!!!"
1,2023-06-09,Staff not friendly and not available,"staff not friendly and not available, send them to leeds ls10 puregym gave experience . definitely they are smiling (at least) with selective people only. check your cams."
1,2023-09-04,They are happy to employ someone who…,"they are happy to employ someone who was sacked for dealing drugs to prisoners whilst he worked in the prison service. they are fully aware of his drug dealing past and are still happy for him to work with 16 year olds on a daily basis, this is quite frankly sham  i have previously contacted pure gym head office and they do not give a monkeys theyre safe space code is nothing but lip service"
3,2023-09-03,"Well equipped and good value, but…","friendly staff, open 24 hours, good selection of equipment, not as intimidating as some gym spaces, and good value. the only real downside to things is equipment hygiene. during staffed hours you do see staff occasionally coming round to clean equipment, but often, especially during unstaffed hours because it’s a gym and folk sweat, you can find yourself using equipment that’s “greasy”. hygiene stations are standard in most gyms for this very reason, and have been standard equipment in gyms long before the pandemic. puregym deciding to remove hygiene stations and using the end of the pandemic and being “more sustainable” as the reasoning seems either a tad disingenuous or worryingly short sighted.  other than the hygiene issue it’s a good gym with friendly staff that’s suitable for all abilities."
5,2023-09-09,Chloe PT Haverhill,i first met chloe in a personal training session and she made me feel comfortable with my surroundings straight away i am a 60 yr old and haven’t been to a gym for many years so i was extremely nervous and worried what to expect but chloe was amazing with her understanding nature she knew what i needed after the first session the 8 week plan she had for me worked!!! i’m now 16lb lighter lost inches and my confidence has gone through the roof i have even started classes with chloe i couldn’t be more impressed she is a kind and lovely person who knows her stuff !!! and when ever i’m in the gym she will always come over to see how i’m getting on which is lovely i honestly cannot praise her enough i am so please with my results and i’m going from strength to strength 👍😁
5,2023-09-09,Bradley Copus at PureGym Edgware,"i wanted to take a moment to express our gratitude to bradley copus not only for his high professionalism, but also for the dedication and guidance in helping us achieve our fitness goals. his knowledge and expertise have been invaluable to all of us. his positive attitude and encouragement have also been a tremendous motivator. bradley is very attentive to each of us checking how correctly we perform the exercises and managing to come up to each of us during the lesson and correct. he always made sure that everyone in the group was able to keep up with the pace of the session. his consideration as well аs exceptional service and commitment to our health and wellness is greatly appreciated. overall, we found his training to be very beneficial and  are feeling more and more confident in our ability to apply the knowledge he has been sharing with us."
5,2023-09-09,Brilliant value for money,"brilliant value for money this company far exceeds any expectation - the machinery is modern and just as much of it when comparing to other more expensive gyms. who needs the wet soggy and time consuming additions such as pool, sauna and steam room at extra cost when there is this."
4,2023-09-09,Edinburgh Craigleith Great Gym but the studio is too dark and claustrophobic,"the gym is clean with lots of new equipment and easily accessible. the trainers are friendly and helpful. however, its ground-level studio, where group classes are held, is too dark and claustrophobic. perhaps, the management could provide adequate lighting."
1,2023-09-04,"Very disappointed, hot and smelly","on my way into the gym this week (hottest week of the year!) i was told by a member of staff that the aircon wasn’t working. i then followed him into the ladies changing rooms (he was doing a cleanliness check) and the smell 💩 ewwww. the ladies toilets were not working (never known them to be working since i joined in august). but the smell mixed with the heat in the gym was not motivating me to workout. i left after 45 minutes of cardio dripping with sweat and feeling slightly sick from the smell. not in a hurry to go back so membership fee wasted. shame as i really wanted to do this and felt motivated after struggling with mental health issues for years. wouldn’t recommend at the moment, not until they get the toilet problem and aircon sorted. have sent an email asking what they plan to do and after five days, not had a reply. going to cancel my membership and find an alternative gym. being over 50 myself, a working toilet is a must!"
3,2023-09-01,Does the job,"i mainly joined because of the frequency of spin classes compared to my previous gym (an even lower budget gym in leeds city centre). however, i would otherwise much prefer to have remained there. i don’t like essentially being in a cave when i work out, without any natural light or phone signal - the fluorescent lights and typical gym smell that hit you as soon as you get in is pretty overwhelming. it also feels quite packed and chaotic when you walk in, and is very much like a fishbowl, with nowhere to hide. compared to my former gym, there seems to be a much higher percentage of ‘gym bros’ parading around, and i find it quite intimidating that they’re allowed to sit on the bikes behind the instructor on their phones for the whole spin class, not actually participating but watching the rest of us (i was even getting paranoid one was taking photos). the very fact that the spin classes are right in the middle of the gym with everyone watching is in itself daunting. as a whole it feels very impersonal, and the instructors seem great but there just doesn’t seem to be a culture of communicating with each other in classes (possibly due to the transient nature of such gym memberships, with people coming and going). it’s quite nice to be able to slip in and out unnoticed, and i can certainly see the appeal of anonymity when looking and feeling at your absolute worst, but eye contact and a hello/smile/getting to know the names of regulars doesn’t go amiss. i realise a lot of this is down to personal preference, so i don’t expect the gym to be able to do much about this.  however, in terms of improvements, things i would ideally like to see are proactive efforts to make it more inclusive (this worked really well at my former gym - it doesn’t cost much to stick up some posters etc making it clear that people of any shape/size/background are welcome, as well as making women feel safer in what is quite a testosterone-fuelled environment), and practically, a bit of a service of the spin bikes (some of the screens don’t work, foot straps are loose etc) and an improvement on the availability of cleaning products (e.g. spray and paper - the bin never seems to get emptied and they’re always running out). in an ideal world i’d also love to see a bigger variety of classes."
5,2023-09-08,Caroline Lofthouse yoga teaching is…,"caroline lofthouse yoga teaching is first class. very well instructed to all levels of ability. caroline is helping me develop my yoga practice. the improvement in my practice in a relatively short amount of time is great. caroline is patient, client focused and offers a well guided practice."
1,2023-09-08,Broken AC. Again,"it’s odd. every year in the summer when there’s a heatwave, the air con breaks. then in the winter, the heating breaks. so yet again the air con is broken, staff state it will be fixed next week after the heatwave. don’t join if you want a pleasant workout"
3,2023-09-08,Underage gym goers,still under 16 using the gym despite this being mentioned a few months back. shouldn’t be down to me to inform management. management need to be checking 13/14 year olds using the weights!!!
2,2023-09-08,Member feedback,"i enjoy using the gym, however, im left frustrated by the following points, which i dont believe justifies my £29.99 membership cost.  1: air con the gym temperature makes for an awful workout experience, its simply too hot. i see in other peoples feedback youve mentioned the temperature is automatically controlled, which might be true in the cardio section of the gym, as that is always refreshingly cool. however, the free weights area and immediately to the left as you enter, it needs addressing. the air con is not functioning in these here, and hasnt done for years. previously, ive just got on with it, but its beyond a joke now, members deserve better and shouldn’t have to work out in a pool of their own sweat.  2: the time it takes for equipment to be fixed – an example being the cable machine upstairs. this is now approaching months out of action, which isnt acceptable considering how busy it can get  3: lat pull down attachments - can we have some more up-to-date attachments please (i cant insert the url, but google ""mirafit gym cable machine attachment set - 5 handles"" and youll know the ones im referring to). the gym used to have one of them, but that disappeared a few months back and hasnt been replaced  finally, a suggestion box is mentioned by yourselves in the previous reviews, which is a good idea. but i havent been able to locate it? if its in the office, i think it should be moved somewhere else to allow people to provide constructive criticism without having to speak to a staff member, it might reduce some of the negatives reviews you have here, as members are frustrated by issues they would like to be resolved, but dont have a way to report them"
2,2023-09-07,Topless gym,"i do love the gym but when the mostafa as himself as pt trainer showing off his body and  walk topless at the gym my mother cant  do workout because she too shy to see mens naked body. but because  of that he encouraged  other young kids and guys showing  off they body and they  do  take a pictures themselves in the big yoga room where you have a lots of mirrows. i am not going  anymore to gym because, it is like topless show and my mother as well. we changed the gym because of that. if you want walk topless or naked and show off your body i believe gym is the social  place it is not the place to do so. there privet places where you can do it so."
1,2023-04-07,The gym in Camden (London),"the puregym in camden (london), its small, the equipment is ok. the showers and changing room is to small and gets cramped, at peak times. the toilets are tiny and dirty. the staff are quite and keep to themselves, but they are friendly."
1,2023-09-07,Equipment is terrible worst gym I have trained in. …,"equipment is basic which i understand for a corporate gym. the problem is there is so little of it. due to the high intake of clients it is broke often. at the moment broken equipment is cable machine, lumbar extension, leg press, leg extension. only 1 of each item so no other equipment to use the same. i have to now pay to go another gym at weekends to get a full training session. there is multiple treadmills broke. some equipment is dangerous as missing safety caps for eg pec dec. the equipment takes months to be fixed and loads of other equipment on its way out, completely rusted. air conditioning is turned off a lot of the time now in hot weather. tvs are not allowed to be switched on now. music was even off for a bit. worst gym to be in at present. very dirty in places. there is no action when feedback given by management at all and i have held back on a review for so long. it is so un motivating to train in. just lack of gyms in the area. no 24 hour ones either which is the only positive point i can give. looked for headquarters email and asked for contact details in the gym - none found or given. if you are into your fitness/weight training this is not for you. if you wanna go to chat or sit on your phone maybe it is. double your training time as queues for equipment as so little of it. in need of a total refurb. pure gym warrington and crewe are 💯 better with motivated staff so not all are as bad as northwich."
4,2023-09-07,4 starts because there's always room…,"4 stars because theres always room for improvement. however, i would give my pt charlie bishop 5 stars. i only re-joined this gym so i could train with charlie. i had been to her classes before so when i needed a pt i messaged her. in the last 7 months or so she has helped me recover from a major surgery. i was in constant pain and now im in no pain. i also find training with her really fun. its a space where i can play and be silly and get fitter at the same time. the other staff that ive met have also been great. thanks lads."
1,2023-09-05,Tuesday 5th September 2023 another no…,"tuesday 5th september 2023 another no show at the 9.15am cycle class. no instructor 👨‍🏫. no staff members,. just disappointed members. pure gym needs to sort it out and provide alternative cover if staff members are on holiday. this is totally unacceptable."
2,2023-09-07,Hednesford pure gym is like a sauna,"hednesford pure gym is like a sauna, the air conditioning hasnt been working since around may. i have put plenty of complaints in regarding the air conditioning since may and nothing has been done. im really considering moving gyms as its way too hot in there, i understand when doing a workout that you will build up a sweat, but i can run for 1 minute and the sweat is pouring out of me and im quite fit! please get this air conditioning sorted as i feel customers will also be moving to a gym that has air conditioning just like this gym should have! im going to be getting in contact with health and safety as this is not safe as customers could pass out due to fitness and how hot it is in the gym"
3,2023-09-06,Its good but could be perfect with a few tweaks,not to bad for the price but its is missing a few key pieces of equipment such as the seated leg curl which has been proven to activate 50% more of hamstring when compared then the conventional flat hamstring curls. theres no hack squat machine which for me is a necessity to really hit the quads hard and theres also no weighted ab machines. the only option we have for the upper abs is crunches on the functional trainer but for some strange reason theres is a notice on the functional trainer which states not to do ab crunches on it. if you follow the rules youd have no equipment for upper ab work.
5,2023-08-12,Great gym,"i really like this gym. there is a really relaxed feel about it. i never feel intimidated and even at points where footfall is high, it never really feels super busy. there is a good amount of equipment and the whole thing just feels slick and well thought out.  as a female i am however worried about my attendance to this gym over the winter period. i can only really attend pre-work between 5-6am(ish) and at the moment its light enough to feel safe walking from the car park if you move quickly. once the clocks go back i cant see myself confidently walking from the car park to the gym at this hour, unless i wait in my car until i see another person who looks like a gym-goer but thats not ideal. this isnt necessarily the gyms problem (hence no drop in stars) and i cant think how this can really be rectified other than perhaps the gym discussing with the council and seeing if anything can be put in place to make that walkthrough feel more secure. im really keen to give it a go and just hope the lighting is enough to make it feel safer."
1,2023-09-06,Rules?! what rules?!,"rules from their own general gym rules that no one follows (found below, if that matters at all) www[dot]puregym[dot]com/gym-rules/  might as well just remove this from your website because certainly none of these are followed in east india gym!!  ... bring and use sweat towels ... ... bags are not permitted onto the gym floor ... ... clothing such as ... flip-flops/sandals ... are not permitted. you may not use the gym whilst under the influence of alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers or any medication or other substance ... ... ensure that you put your weights back in their original place ... ... do not misuse the weights by dropping them on the floor ... ... only use the lockers for the duration of their training session ..."
5,2023-04-20,Great customer service,"easy to sign up, just as easy to cancel if need be. customer service team always happy to help"
4,2023-09-07,Good gym but hammer curl machine has issues,"ive been going to this gym for 2 weeks now and im happy with the gym, however it could do with thumb print entry instead of pins and qr codes just incase i dont have access to my mobile phone for the qr code or pin, also the hamstring curl machine has an issue where when you lie down on it, theres a bump where it inclines causing pain and discomfort on the quads due to the pressure put on them when lieng down, i have to put my jacket on the bump to reduce the pressure on my quads. ive been to simply gym,snap fitness and area 51 and never experienced this problem before, but aparts from that its a good gym overall"

1,2023-09-06,No working air conditioning yet again…,"no working air conditioning yet again for the hottest week of the year. complaint raised with pure gym via twitter who are adamant it’s working when it’s clearly not, i’ve put my hand in front of the ac vents and it’s pumping out warm air! utter joke."
5,2023-09-06,Choosing a good personal trainer,"i have been training with luca for several months now, having previously trained with other trainers in other gyms. luca is absolutely the best trainer ive trained with. his expert knowledge of positioning to avoid injury and hand placement has taught me to be confident in the gym when going by myself. in fact, he is the only trainer in 5 years who has got me to a point where im confident to go to the gym on my own as well as train with him. i saw a big increase in my strength whilst training with him and would highly recommend him. i honestly wouldnt train with anybody else anymore, he really is the best and i speak from personal experience. hes very professional, knowledgeable, friendly and easy to chat to. you wont go wrong training with luca and it wont be long before you see a difference from your training.."
1,2023-07-19,A car crash of a gym being run to the ground,"puregym muswell hill has consistently dropped in quality of management, equipment, classes and pts since i moved to it a few years ago. the latest management seems inadequate frankly, creating a hostile environment and causing a number of the best pts to leave. i have to say that some of the pts left behind are as bad as the management. one pt, a certain female that this review won’t let me name, screams across the gym at people, sits on equipment and prevents others from using it, does tarot cards in the middle of the gym and is rude and obnoxious. another pt, toby blasts music so loud you can hear it wherever you are in the building, smashes bikes in his spin classes so hard that the ground below him shakes and a light fitting over a treadmill is almost ready to drop, and seems to spend much of his time “on shift” actually just on his phone or on the massage beds. the management also has no concern for the standards within the gym - it stinks, the toilets are disgusting and the gym floor is always a mess. what’s more, there’s always groups of teenage boys hogging equipment and being generally loud and obnoxious. i really do not understand how puregym head office is letting this all happen. the talented staff are leaving, and the customers will follow. i’ve cancelled my membership to this gym because it’s not a place i feel happy or comfortable being in anymore."
4,2023-09-06,This gym is amazing for space,"this gym is amazing for space, equipment and quiet areas. the huge let down is how hot it is always seems to be in the morning time. the air conditioning is really bad literally to the point you sometimes feel quite faint while working out. i don’t want to leave as it is a great gym and close to me but it’s ridiculous how hot it is in there. it is a 24 hour gym so the air conditioning should be on at all times not just at day/peak times. it’s difficult for people with astma like my sister to go also attends. really hope this problem could be addressed as i have really settled here, also the workout mats in the studio areas are really filthy. they always leave marks on my leggings/knees. if they air conditioning was better quality and on during all opening hours it would have been 5* from me."
4,2023-09-06,Lovely gym but not the cleanest,lovely gym but not the cleanest good classes and equipment but perhaps a bit more attention can be paid at the cleanliness/hygiene in showers and wc its progressively getting worse with each week. thats the only bad point
3,2023-09-06,Love how friendly it is the staff are…,love how friendly it is the staff are amazing and helpful  last few times ive been in not seen the manager assistant manager however looks burnt out and in need of time off  best gym to still go to
2,2023-09-06,The gym is useless borough / London…,"the gym is useless borough / london bridge branch  - since the new management took over, the gym has been unable to open on time (again). i am on my third visit and the gym has opened late. please do better. in the event that you cannot open on time, you should offer discounts on memberships."
1,2023-09-05,The worse pure gym I've ever worked out in,"first visit to this gym and what a joke, very disappointed with this gym. most of the lockers were out of use, the machines have not been maintained. the hygiene left me feeling like i was going to pick up some bug from how unclean the place was. freezing cold showers, no staff about it when their was they were not very friendly the cycle room was unsafe as the instructor kept the light off id have cancelled my membership of this was my gym. i know the area is rough but you could take better care of the place"
4,2023-09-05,Been a great gym for years,"been a great gym for years, but some of the machines a looking tired, could do with upgrade, and also clocks on the wall please to check the time, as the tvs are all switched off, as a cost cutting exercise, 😩"
5,2023-09-05,After reading the bad reviews,"after reading some of the bad reviews i felt like writing one myself, nothing is perfect and for what we pay the staff and trainers do a fab job. the trainers are not there to pick up after members where they leave equipment, this is down to users to place back, my experience at puregym has been positive the trainers are knowledgeable and push you beyond what you thought was possible. i have been using this gym now for 2 years and i’am the strongest and healthiest i’ve been since children and probably even before, the trainers are friendly and supportive in classes the trainers make the gym one of the best ones i’ve been too,"
5,2023-09-02,Love my PT sessions with Kellie,"i love my sessions with kellie she is amazing and i always feel amazing after! friendly vibes from staff and other members, it’s clean and tidy!"
2,2023-08-28,Old and done in,"i use multiple puregym locations due to travel for work and staying at my partners in the south side. recently i have started using the newly opened giffnock branch and the comparison is horrendous. robroyston is in dire need of a refurb / upgrade. not a single thing has changed or been upgraded since it opened years ago. it’s not big enough for the level of use - especially at peak time. it’s not up to date with the changes to the fitness industry and the type of equipment / attachments that are now available. it’s pretty shameful that there are members who will pay the same for this sub par gym compared to those that have cleaner, newer and better facilities. absolutely dread when i have to use this location now."
3,2023-08-29,Bootcamp class,"dear puregym, ive been a member for a while and every visit has always been an amazing experience. the gym is well equipped and the staff is always kind, helpful and knowledgeable. im a regular participant of the bootcamp class of finchley on tuesday evenings, this classs been the core part of my weekly fitness routine. or i have to say it was, as the classd been removed from the timetable, which came as a shocking surprise last tuesday. im extremely disappointed with this decision. it was a popular class and theres not even a similar one on the timetable. please consider bringing this class back, i recon im not the only member who would like that. thank you."
2,2023-09-05,Bentley Bridge branch - Getting Unusable,"unfortunately now, the gym is walking on the edge of unusable.  the gym for months now has had over  5- 8 pieces of equipment out of order reducing what you can do.  whilst i understand equipment will go down, having it out of commission for months with no end in sight, it now appears pure gym just do not want to get the companies in to fix them and pay the bill.  all the while still collecting the same gym fees, which feels like a con as a premium member as i am paying for something i am not getting.  at this rate i maybe forced to moved to jd gymupdate: as of september 13th from 1 star to a 2 star.credit where credit is due, the very next day after writing the original review, they had a couple guys in and fixed approx 3 machines.  there are still some out and the main issue is that the machines that are out are the main stays for most people, so would be nice if this was rectified, but they have come in and repaired about 40 percent now, so its a step in the right direction."
2,2023-08-21,Too busy and badly laid out,"far too crowded at peak times, between 5-8 its so busy you struggle to get on weight machines or benches. full of kids, sorry but the age should be put up as theres just groups of young lads who have no idea what theyre even doing and will end up hurting themselves most likely. quite small compared to other pure gyms..on a retail park and cross trainers and stepper rammed into the front window/corner so everyone stares are you when theyre out doing their shopping. no cleaning stations. would be good if they sorted out the lay out and upped the age to enter, plus added cleaning stations, all just seems rushed."
1,2023-09-05,First day at the gym and very…,"first day at the gym and very disappointed, no cleaning stations and only limited sets of equipment due to gym being so small. it was quite so the limited equipment wasnt a issue. it would be a nightmare during busy periods waiting on equipment. i hope cleaning stations are put in place quickly as i will be leaving if it doesnt happen. nobody wants to excersise on sweat covered wquipment."
2,2023-09-04,Improvements needed,"over the past few months i feel that standards have slipped at the luton and dunstable gym. there are constantly issues will the ladies toilets, whether that be no toilet roll/soap, toilets out of order, hand dryer out of order, sinks flooded and today no not water. the soap dispenser is broken and when you push it to get soap out the front of it falls off. i’m also uncomfortable with how much male employees go into the ladies changing room. they do open the door and announce themselves but it’s not very nice if you are in the middle of changing. i have used this gym for many years now and it’s not as good as it used to be. the air con in the ladies only section didn’t seem to be working today, it was very stuffy and almost unbearable. the changing rooms and the rest of the gym seemed to have air con. there doesn’t seem to be as many classes on the time table, especially spin. i think there are only 3 outside office hours on the time table."
1,2023-09-04,This gym needs more equipment,"this gym needs more equipment one preacher curl ? 3 benches at dumbbells isn’t enough very expensive for a small gym in comparison to other larger pure gyms so much wasted space pure gyms are generally excellent imho but this needs worked on inside , it’s handy for quick workout but disappointing overall the smith machine seems cheap in comparison to other pure gyms ? also the benches aren’t the same quality just seems a bit of a rushed gym this one to get opened . will use occasionally on way to work but disappointing"
5,2023-09-04,Excellent gym and staff,"been attending this new gym for 4 weeks now.  very impressed so far.  all the instructors are great - full of encouragement and motivation.  only do the classes as dont really understand how to use the machines in the main gym area, but i can always ask if i really wanted to know!  being of menopausal age, and not having done any classes for a few years, it was a big leap of faith joining this gym but im so glad i did.  the endorphins that now charge through my veins at full speed after every class have completely changed my outlook on life and i am so much more positive and motivated as a result.  just wish they had a personal trainer who specialised in menopausal women!  but you cant have everything!!"
5,2023-09-03,Puregym Is my go to,puregym is my go to. it has a good community and even thou the ladies toilets get blocked i still wouldnt go elsewhere. great pts and classes are varied too. my pt fraser is the best. he truly amazes me with new routines from his classes kickboxing glutes metcon and wod. in my pt sessions he pushes me showing me what im capable of. truly has changed me physically and mentally for the better. thank you fraser for your professionalism. your like a wizard conjuring new ways of keeping fitness challenging but fun.

1,2023-09-04,Cold showers that reek of pee,"the showers are like a roller coaster of sadness, tepid to freezing and using the excuse of saving energy isnt going to stop me from finding a gym that lets me have a decent shower. if you really care about improving your carbon footprint put in some solar panels etc so there is actually some hot water.  also the changing rooms have been reeking of pish for months now. either your members are spray and prayers or you have a pretty serious sewage problem"
5,2023-09-03,Richie Cephus,"i have been training since last 3 years elsewhere and moved to pure gym burnham late last year. i started training with richie since january 23, this year and had an absolutely amazing transformation not only physically but also mentally, training with richie has made me feel more confident and strong both physically and mentally. he is very focused in sessions, listens to you and his training is tailored for individuals as per their needs. his sessions and classes are always very different and he always pushes you out of the comfort zone, he is very dedicated towards the gym and his clients. i also feel majority of the members actually train with him, which is a very big reason why people come to burnham gym including myself. i say this, as gym could do with some improvements around building management i.e. toilets are always blocked, very frequent leaks,some equipments need replacing, etc. overall positive atmosphere and great helpful team like jelena, harry, eddie, fraser, brilliant interaction and classes from them too, thank you :))"
1,2023-08-09,MONEY SNATCHING PT,money snatching pt do not use any of the personal trainers at the gym! i had a private lesson with christina harris and she never showed up and hasnt paid me back. shes a scammer and the gym have taken no responsibility for it. they have refused to pay me back and offered me zero compensation. do not waste your money on this crap excuse of a gym theres gyms way better than this.
5,2023-09-03,I loved my first day in the gym,i loved my first day in the gym. i tried out one of their circuit classes and really liked seeing a mix of people in the class and not just a load of really fit young people.  i found the size to be comfortable as i was nervous going into a large gym with loads of equipment but found my way around there no problem.
1,2023-09-02,OK if you enjoy the smell of urine,this gym is ok if you enjoy the smell of urine. as soon as you walk in you’re hit in the face with the smell of urine which is quite unpleasant. as you enter the female changing rooms it only gets worse. not to mention the lack of cleanliness and poor facilities. half the machines throughout the gym are becoming broken and music from the classes during the day is unbearably loud. i actually hate it here.
5,2023-09-02,Mihaela such great PT I love all her…,"mihaela such great pt i love all her classes specially the cycle she does pushes us to our limits, shes a great motivation."
1,2023-09-01,ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!,seriously guys you need to get some active professional customer service. you can’t speak to a human. messenger takes 10 hours to respond. then have to email of which was done 2pm yesterday and still no reply. can’t access gym now for 2 days yet you have taken my money. spend some money on decent customer service where people get a quick response

5,2023-08-31,JoJo,"im a member for over 2 years. i attend classes and have pt sessions. pt is the main reason that im coming to the gym everyday. my pt is richard and i couldnt have asked for a better one. pushes you to your limits, believes in you and just when you think you cant do anything else, you still get up ready for more. really difficult to find such a dedicated trainer. 5 stars easy classes with him are very one of the best ones you can find. always high level of work but thats what we need. note to the management: please reinstate sundays sweat 45 class. these were life saver for people working full time and having time for crazy workout only on weekends."
4,2023-09-01,I just finished using my 3 day pass and…,"i just finished using my 3 day pass and really happy to finally have a ladies only space that has decent equipment! can i please request us ladies to have a cable machine , lat pull down, steps, ab balls ! this would compliment the space nicely and it will be a more all round functional space !"
5,2023-08-30,Great Spot,"i love puregym. such a positive environment. super clean and classes are great.  richard is the greatest trainer out there. i suffered back pain for nearly five years. chiro, osteo, pilates, yoga—nothing helped. i’d be lost without him. i can actually live again—pain free!"
5,2023-09-01,"Pure gym Cardiff bay,clean gym staff…","pure gym cardiff bay,clean gym staff are very friendly and helpful my only frustration is cancelling classes at last minute ,has happened 3 times in last week for me , know lack of staff at moment,but cancel classes mid morning all the time,need to sort it out , today i had 2 classes cancelled on me. i dont like like weights all the time i like the variety of classes and i dont want to do them early morning at 7 or late at night, its always mid morning classes cancelled so please sort it out soon."
5,2023-09-01,Loving the new women’s only section,"loving the new women’s only section, i can’t tell you how refreshing it is to see women being taken seriously in the gym, being given our own equipment and a nice decent space. i am so psyched to see more women pick up that barbell and realise their potential, it’s life changing!the space and equipment are varied and can accommodate many different types of training.  i wish that women’s only sections existed years ago when i was brand new to the gym and feeling intimidated and out of place, especially as a smaller woman who absolutely doesn’t look like a fitness model. lifting has transformed my mental and physical health, and i’d hate any woman to miss out on that due to not feeling safe or comfortable in a mixed space.  i do sympathise with the negative review, the gym can certainly be an intimidating place for men too. however women have long been pushed out of the heavy weights section. if you look at how health and fitness are marketed to men and women differently, you can see that we still have a long way to go in achieving true equity. glad that pure gym have taken real steps to address this. if you’re a woman unsure about starting or coming back to the gym, pure gym offers a welcoming, calm and judgement free women only space. come in and try it out, you won’t regret it!"
5,2023-02-19,Good Value for Money,flexible clean and good variety of equipment
5,2023-08-31,Best PT and supportive gym environment,"i love this gym and have found a very supportive community within it. richard has been my pt for over 2.5 years and i can honestly say that he is amazing! i get easily bored, but no two sessions are the same; they are always varied and really full on which i enjoy. i am an older client, but i get stronger and fitter everyday, and enjoy training hard most days of the week. richard is one of the most kind, inspiring and motivational people ive ever met and he has had a massive impact in my life. richard has allowed me to achieve things that i never thought i would be able to do. i only wish id met him sooner! if you want a supportive and encouraging pt, richard is the one for you."
5,2023-08-01,You get what you put in,"you get what you put in , but what helps are the people around you and in short the trainers that help  i have been with one particular trainer who has helped me find my passion and enjoy this gym in every way  always enjoyed doing my training here . staff are always happy to help."
5,2023-08-31,PT with Richard,"ive been a member at this gym for a year now and have pt sessions with richard - he is the best pt ive ever had! i lost 1 stone in 3 months and hes very good at holding you accountable, he put together a meal plan and i have set workouts to follow too with regular weigh-ins! richards classes are a killer but you feel amazing by the end of it!! best pt ever and i couldnt have lost the weight without him!"

5,2023-08-28,My rating is based on my trainer…,"my rating is based on my trainer ritchie who is incredible. to train with ritchie i am prepared to overlook the the questionable cleanliness, the frequently blocked loos and rain buckets for leaky roofs. i only go early and think there is a good atmosphere, friendly people no judgements, good community. that said,  if ritchie wasn’t there i don’t think i would be either and my rating would drop to 1. tom, eddie and harry are great, always helpful, good classes and friendly/professional."

5,2023-08-28,PTs come and go however...,ive been a member since puregym opened and pts come and go but rich is an extremely motivating and focused trainer. his classes are high tempo and not for the faint hearted....you get out what you put in. his pt sessions are hell but the confidence he has in pushing your boundaries is second to none.....i opted for pt thinking it would be for a couple of months and 18 months later im still hooked. its bizarrely the one point of the week i look forward to whilst dreading what on earth is he gonna subject me to this week.....absolutely amazing
4,2023-08-31,Friendly staff,gym is stuffy at times and can get busy but does not cause me any issues the staff i know are  richard and tom i do richards classes they are awesome and he pushes you to exercise to the best of your ability.as a personal trainer he is kind and motivates me to achieve the best i can for my physical health and mental well being richard is friendly and i always see him helping others

4,2023-08-31,Being member since it opened,"being member since it opened, the gym is fine it has almost everthy i need apart from punch bag, but my only complaint at the moment is that the website, use to, but it doesnt show anymore,  how many people in the gym at the time, so you can come at less busy time, and also doesnt show your activity anymore..how many session you did and time and date and length of session. hope you bring back these on the website. thank you."

1,2023-08-30,Cancelled after on month of use,"cancelled after on month of use  i went once a week for a month to try it out.  visit 1: did a hiit class and the class was basically 30 minutes of one circuit. no breaks and rotating through 4 movements. by far the worst class ive ever been to.  visit 2: workout in general weights area was fine but no hot water.  visit 3: emergency evacuation to gym due to lack of power. gym went completely dark mid workout. insufficient emergency lighting. still no hot water to showers  visit 4: still no hot water, spin bike i tried to use had a loose pedal crank and was rattling so i couldnt do the desired workout.  also, no phone reception down there and connecting to wifi is a very annoying process."

1,2023-08-30,Real let down with the classes,"real let down with the classes, 6/10 instructors not available, fail to notify on the app, extremely short staffed, dont bank on the classes, its been like this all year. see for yourself, dont say i didnt warn you. keep saying theyre going to improve but as i said, its been like this all year with no warning on the app."
2,2023-08-01,Don’t feel comfortable as a woman,"don’t feel comfortable as a woman. men stare at you like dogs the second you walk in, as you must pass the entire gym to get to the changing rooms. has most machines for a small gym however not enough space in free weights room- can fit 9 people max, so not worth paying £28 per month. staff are alright and location is convenient though"

2,2023-08-18,Very Dirty Gym,"hi ive recently joined the gym at eastgate. ive been going to a lot of classes which i am enjoying. however, the studio where the classes take place is really dirty. after every class my hands are filthy and the water is black when i wash them. do you clean the studio and the exercise mats? it doesnt seem like they are cleaned regularly.  i am also shocked at how filthy the water fountain is, last time i went to use it, there was old hair and lumps of something brown in the drain. it was really disgusting. people will get sick if it remains that dirty.  can you please reassure me that there is a regular cleaning service at eastgate gym, and that they will step up their game to keep the gym users safe and healthy?"
3,2023-05-31,No AC,"was a member for puregym for a good few years but realised that they had started keeping the ac off due to the cost of ""energy crisis"" witch is an absolute joke for one of the most successful gyms on the planet.  i asked a member of staff if they could switch it on but they said it was internally controlled & theres nothing they could do. so myself & quite a few friends it turns out had the same issue so we all left for new gyms. its a shame you used to be able to challenge & push yourself there for a good workout now after 5 sets you need a 10 minute break outside because its to hot & the air is stale dam shame theyve let themselves go in standards."
4,2023-08-29,Please can we have our classes back,dear pure gym management i’ve been going to pure gym finchley east end road since january 2023 and really enjoy my experience every day i attend a few classes a week which i thoroughly enjoy! coming to the gym has not only been amazing for my physical health it has helped me with my mental health too. it’s an amazing place to come to let off steam and take my mind off daily stresses and work stress ! i got into a real routine weekly which has made such a difference to my life. the staff are all so helpful and polite. unfortunately this week all that has changed with the switch around of classes due from next week ! the classes i enjoy box fit and  boot camp on tuesday and burn it on thursday have completely changed and has left me quite upset that my structure is gone ! these are such popular classes and i really can’t understand why there was a need for any change! everyone in the class was so disappointed! please can we have our classes back again? this makes such a difference to so many of us who come from near and far for these classes we are all so disappointed at the changes and can’t fathom a reason for it and a lot of the classes on a friday are exactly the same it’s really ruining my experience hope this will be taken into consideration distraught member

1,2023-08-29,"Equipment breaks, do nothing.","edit* response from puregym we do regular maintenance, and wait for engineers? did the engineers take over 2 months to replace the batteries in the broken clock? routine checks? funny. because them cross trainers have been broke for months!!! do your job or leave!!! you dont even put a sign on the broken machines. should legal be involved if a person gets injured from your lack of intelligence? you do nothing, and let your customers use broken machines because you dont care  only having 2 cross trainers is bad enough for a gym. but then when one of them stops working you do nothing. also pt tom will happily take your money, and now for over a year still owes me lessons. dont bother. this location is run badly, and equipment including the clock is left to fault like the fates of the management here"
1,2023-08-29,Non-existing customer service,non-existing customer service over the phone if you want to cancel and refund you have to wait ages for the automated response to get back to you. unacceptable for such a high price you pay for a average gym.
5,2023-08-28,Instructor Feedback,ive been enjoying nathans classes lately because he makes the effort to push each individual out of their comfort zone. he pays attention to everyone even if youre at the back. he takes time helping you correct your form/technique without making you feel embarrassed. he has improved my confidence & helped me build my strength massively. nathan puts a lot of effort into his classes always pushing for maximum effort from everyone ensuring you leave feeling like youve worked out. he also has a great sense of humour and never fails to make me laugh through the class which definitely helps ease the pain. i always look forward to it each week no matter what class it is.
1,2023-08-24,Not worth it whatsoever,"the gym is incredibly busy, even in the evening from 8-10pm. i am surprised that there are barely any staff present and so many people are squatting on the power cage despite no safety guards being available - especially after the death of justyn vicky (bodybuilder who died after failing a squat and the barbell breaking his neck). barely any point signing up to the gym unless you are a fan of queueing for equipment. on top of this the weights are never put back in the right rack even if they are available. worst gym i have been to by far, its a shame because there is a tonne of space that is not being utilized - ridiculous when the freeweights area is packed full of people tip toeing over one another - causing even more safety issues."
1,2023-08-28,So disappointed,so disappointed. puregym muswell hill have cancelled another class?? please can someone explain what has happened to this gym?? pts are dropping like flies and there are barely any classes anymore. monday 6pm pump with murat was my favourite.
1,2023-08-27,Bring back wash stations ASAP,"please puregym livingston bring back wash stations for equipment! this is a major step backwards and one where people will leave. no wash stations to wash dirt equipment is a major negative! treadmills are sodden with sweat and stains, fixed weights much the same."
1,2023-08-28,Used to be great - pure gym muswell hill,"i used to love this gym, having been a member here for almost 3 years. promises of a gym refurbishment which hasnt happened, poor management, and high staff turn over. air con is v bad and there is always a smell in the gym. groups of young guys hogging all the machines. murat leaving is the icing on the cake. he was my pt for two years. he will be a massive loss to this gym. my husband and i have both cancelled our memberships"
1,2023-08-24,"No available parking, No available showers","i find it really hard to access this gym due to people using the car park as their workplace or home parking. i often attend after work and appreciate it is peak time but when you witnesses the same people week in week out walking from work to their car or others who manage to park walk out of the car park towards the city it’s unacceptable. the car park is never policed. just get anpr and give people 2/3 hours of free parking. surely it’s not a hard fix to a large long standing problem.  similarly with the showers. long standing problem, easy fix. either refit the showers to a good standard and keep them clean or just fix them and clean them up. i usually have to stand after a workout waiting for one of the two showers to become free.  it’s very frustrating that pure gym management constantly ignore the issues that are raised or don’t bother to fix the ones that are so clearly viable to them. or maybe they haven’t observed the long standing car parking issues or inspected the showers in months to note that all but two are out of order.  or specifically on the shower issue it’s just a complete lack of communication on the plan to resolve the issue. who knows ?"
5,2023-08-23,PureGym Lambeth is great!,"puregym lambeth is very well equipped, clean & really friendly. i’ve been training with a fantastic personal trainer there (owen harradine), i highly recommend owen. he makes training fun but is also very effective, knowledgeable and really listens.  all the staff are very welcoming."

4,2023-05-25,Great gym,"great gym. clean and lots of equipment. only negative side is that because it’s not open for longer hours , can be extremely busy . almost every equipment taken around peak times or around 6-8pm. i just go later. apart from that spot on gym."

5,2023-08-26,SWEAT30 training session AWESOME,"just had my first ever circuit session sweat30 at tamworth with annie power.  just wow!! absolutely off the scale. great facilities, brilliant instruction and great training as a team.  cannot recommend it highly enough. a fantastic gym with amazing facilities, and annie and the manager on hand with friendly advice.  thankyou, first session of many."
1,2023-08-26,Two days in a row no one bothered…,two days in a row no one bothered showing up for my get started session. i was no nervous about joining a gym and this has completely put me off. i emailed them after noone showed up for the first session. the apologised and booked me onto one the following day. well no one showed up to that one either. i wont bother trying again.
2,2023-08-21,Poor shower facilities,"gym is good but showers are disgusting!! mould growing all around the edges, clogged up sinks, shower gel/shampoo holder rotten, flooded shower base with stinking dirty water and cold water coming from shower. not good!!"
3,2023-08-25,New Management,unfortunately the manager darren and now the assistant manger andrew have both left this gym .these two people where very helpful to me .i just hope the new management team are as good .
1,2023-08-08,Extortionate abuse of parking fines,"do not use this gym on a day pass, despite following all the rules they issued me a £60 parking ticket. absolutely scummy behaviour, tantamount to extortion using the legal system as a vehicle to shake down visitors to the area to milk some quick cash. as an online only company there is no recourse to contact anyone and fix the issue. absolute bullies and abusive of customers."
1,2023-08-24,"please, please, PLEASE just fix the showers","please just sort the showers out. it’s beyond a joke now. 2 working showers. of the working 2, both stink and are moldy. me and many other members are completely fed up with the lack of action on this issue."

1,2023-08-22,SEXUAL HARASSMENT at PUREGYM EDINBURGH…,"sexual harassment at puregym edinburgh craigleith retail park. females beware - sexual predators are infecting this 24 hour gym. my 20 year old daughter was subjected to horrendous sexual attention by 4, yes 4, eastern european men when she attended the gym at 9pm. these “men” ranged in age from mid 20s to mid 40s, so not stupid kids. they surrounded the machine my daughter was using pointing at her and making lewd remarks. she was petrified and tried to ignore these people. luckily there was still a trainer on site and he came and stood with her. he said that the gym was aware of the problem but could do little as they were scared of being labelled “racist”! what is happening with this company when the sensitivities of people like this take precedence over the safety of young women? my wife just happened to pick my daughter up and these “men” were still outside waiting in 2 separate cars. god knows what would have happened if my daughter was forced to walk home through what is a dimly lit walkway with these predators there. when she arrived home she burst in to floods of tears. i am calling on puregym to show zero tolerance to people like this and cancel their membership straight away. they were caught on the cctv so the evidence is there. i am waiting to speak to the manager, once he is available that is, and once my daughter feels confident she can face it. the trainer that helped her knew this was a problem so it’s not as if the problem will come as a surprise to management. i also want to involve the police if my daughter is agreeable as i don’t want other young females to be subjected to this appalling behaviour. come on puregym, sexual harassment in your properties is never, ever acceptable. also, there were a number of male gym users there when this was happening but they never said anything even though they were aware it was going on. if you see it, call it out. if you’re a bit apprehensive then call the police, you could help a young woman out of a terrible predicament. puregym - zero tolerance of sexual harassment now."
5,2023-02-24,Working with Jemma changed my life !,"working with jemma changed my life !! i started off at 110kg , shy, not confident & having no clue what to do. since working with jemma i’m currently 94kg & im way more confident in myself and around the gym. if we never found eachother i would’ve quit the gym after the first week ! jemma is so kind , flexible, understanding, a fantastic listener, reliable, versatile & encouraging - i could go onnn. she saw my potential and pushed me out my comfort zone which was exactly what i needed ! she deserves all the accolades for how hard she works & takes care of her clients (especially me) !!"

1,2023-08-23,Rundown and dirty,"rundown and dirty  i am finding it really hard to workout without sneezing at the gym. there is lots of dust on various surfaces, but especially on the top of wall divides and the vending machines.  not sure if pure gym could have a checklist for cleaning so these areas are not missed."
4,2023-08-23,Kassidy - an amazing PT,"my experience so far has been amazing! i have kassidy as my pt for the past few weeks and have been enjoying my sessions. he is knowledgeable, thorough, patient, provides clear instructions and most importantly, he pushes me and my body to its full potential. in the short time, kassidy has helped me to acknowledge quality over quantity be me taking time to focus on proper form. the sessions are intense and at the end of each one i feel muscles i never knew i had; but each time i walk away feeling i am one step closer to achieving my body goals!💯"
2,2023-08-22,Making changes to the gym without telling customers,i have been using this for over 3 years. i love that they have a studio because there is not enough room to workout in front of the mirrors on both floors. they have recently started a personal training program that is not a part of pure gym membership. i based my work schedule around the availability of the studio but recently they started the personal training which takes up the studio but it isnt posted on the app or the schedule on the board outside. the personal trainer kicked 7 of us out of the studio 10 minutes before the class was starting saying she needs to set up. there was no room near the mirrors on the first and second floor so i left and finished my workout at home. if it continues like this i will go to another gym that actually posts info about the studio in use. seems they are happy to treat the extra-paying customers better than the regular membership customers
5,2023-07-08,PureGym Borough,"puregym borough is much better since they have re done the floor/ changed equipment.  i really enjoy the classes, specifically the ones on thursdays/saturdays with kassidy. he always brings high energy, good vibes and constantly motivating people and pushing everyone to achieve the best results and burn the highest calories!  it would be good if you considering added more variety of classes such as: boxing (boxercise) and another day for step."

2,2023-08-22,No air conditioning. Ever.,"i don’t mean to sound dramatic but it is impossible to workout in summer with no air con and this gym never has it switched on. i will reiterate. there is no a/c. even on the hottest of summer days.  i have been to other gyms (including other pure gyms) and they’ve been ice cold. it makes working out much more enjoyable.  however, whoever runs the gym at mallard road, bournemouth clearly doesn’t like having it switched on.  it is unbearable. no exaggeration. everyone is pouring with sweat. the machines are wet from their sweat. it really needs to be sorted out. unacceptable."
5,2023-08-22,MAX: BEST PERSONAL TRAINER EVER,"max has been my personal trainer for just under a year, what a star he’s been. some people were just born for a particular job and this is what i believe he was born for! he is a great educator, motivator and friend to his clients. i’ve learnt so much about form, pushing past the pain and i’ve realised my true potential in fitness. he has a lot of knowledge that he is keen to share but is also great at articulating things in a way that is motivating and not overwhelming. i work a stressful job and long hours so i needed someone to push me on those hard days and he did just that. some of my most exhausted days i did workouts that i didn’t think i could even do on my full energy mode days!!! that’s the power of a great personal trainer. he is also a genuinely lovely person and has a great energy about himself. he will not only help you get in shape, he will help you transform your mindset and beliefs about moving your body. he has helped me move closer to my dream body goal and i’m so much more excited about training! he’s an asset to pure gym and a very valued and loved pt! thank you max!"
2,2023-08-01,Too Hot. Needs Aircon on!,been to multiple puregyms around the south of birmingham. no big issue with them apart from broken machines taking weeks to be repaired and all of them being too hot to work out without feeling sick from the heat.
1,2023-08-22,Overall it's a okay gym to go,"at least for the brunch in brighton central i frequent it is. with its vast place and a plain interior view, even an inexperienced beginner like me would find it durable to train  low rated buz 1) your trainer lxxx scammed my money, never fulfilled promised session 2) gym manager never reply emails nor helps fix this dispute 3) fake ads about freezing/cancel policy. a waste of more money  will never be back, bye"
2,2023-08-21,Disappointing,"after noticing the cleaning station had completely disappeared from the upper floor, i proceeded to ask a team member where it was. he looked over and noticed it was not there and said “oh it’s supposed to be there”. another team member then told me that it was “broken” and that there was a station downstairs i could use. there was no signage telling anyone this. i do not see the point in having to make my way downstairs to clean something upstairs. personal hygiene is very important so not having a cleaning station on one of the floors is very poor indeed.  i also noticed in the puregym rules and guidelines that “no football strips are to be worn”. however, there has many been many a time when i’ve been there to see many people wearing football strips! why have this in the rules if this particular rule is allowed to be broken?"
1,2023-08-21,Don’t waste your time and money,"don’t waste your time and money. instructors giving gym classes are shocking. classes rarely goes ahead, is never the full 45min or 30min and the variety pre or post work is extremely limited. if there are 4 or less attendees booked per class it will not go ahead without warning. people turn up for fully booked classes with no instructor insight and no one in the gym to give any reason as to why or what is happening. they say you get what you pay for but if you going for the classes you get nothing!"
5,2023-08-21,Class/ instructor review,"have been going to nathan’s sweat 30, burn and lbt classes for the last 3 months. nathan brings so much to his classes. he is enthusiastic, friendly, driven knowledgeable, pushes you to work harder, and is committed to make everyone in the class feel welcome. gives his classes such a personal touch which not all instructors do.  i have lost body fat and built strength and that’s because of him. an asset to the team. thank you nathan."

1,2023-08-18,Rundown and unhygienic,"rundown and unhygienic  the toilets are particularly dirty, with excrement on the walls if these standards are not kept to, are machines ever cleaned?  covid seems along time ago, feels like the place hasnt been cleaned since restrictions were lifted."

1,2023-08-19,Hot and Sweaty.. Aircon fails to cool.,"hot and sweaty. although i expect my workouts to be hard work. it would be made more comfortable with cooler aircon. weirdly, in the changing rooms its freezing.... maybe i just do my cool down in the changing rooms between sets."

KITTYBREWSTER ABERDEEN,air conditioning not working!!! had to cut short my workout just too uncomfortable!!! asked when it was getting fixed was told no response when reported well that’s just not good enough!! pure gym are fast at putting up our fees but very slow at equipment replacement & repairs…i want a date when the air con will be fixed. thank you re pure gym response….i have already discussed with the manager he could not give me a date for when repairs would be carried out that’s why i went on trust pilot!!!!
1,2023-08-20,Becoming unusable,"multiple broken machines. changing rooms have a sewage problem which theyre trying to cover up with air fresheners. music from the classes is unbelievably loud. you can hear it in the car park. obnoxious screaming from the pts who dont seem to notice or care anyone else exists. staff dont clean the place properly. theres always rubbish and mess everywhere. sanitation issues are out of spray and tissues most of the time so theyre pointless. but at least its open 24-7, i guess."
5,2023-08-19,Went to ethans circuit class,"went to ethans circuit class, highly rate it. he joined in with the exercises as there was only 3 of us. good mix of exercises and supportive throughout. definitely worth a quick fat burn"
3,2023-08-17,It is just ok,"the facilities are ok but i prefer woking. in woking, classes are behind frosted glass doors, byfleet has no doors so the classes are a little distracting if you are using the gym - the timer buzzer they use for hiits is quite annoying. the water out of the fountain is warm and a little metallic tasting and the flavoured water machine is still not working so my membership is a little wasted there. it is closer than woking but i will still keep going to woking for better class timings and spinning classes."
2,2023-08-19,Lovely new gym with plenty of fantastic…,lovely new gym with plenty of fantastic equipment and very friendly and helpful staff. only major complaint is that there are no sanitising stations to allow you to clean equipment before and after use. the expectation is that you ask a member of staff to do that for you. this is counter productive and doesn’t allow for a fluent nor safe workout.
3,2023-08-19,Too warm inside,"it looks like the gym is going green - no air conditioning or air vents are functioning, felt warm and stuffy. this isn’t the first time. there are two cleaning stations, most of the detergent containers are empty, usually."
5,2023-08-18,Pure Gym has a nice modern feel to it…,"pure gym has a nice modern feel to it and is well layed out. i mostly attend winterhall and loved the hydrobed after a workout. if only there was space for a steam room but that would put prices up i expect. find it hilarious how people grade gyms on wi-fi. youre there to train so put the silly plastic gimmick in your locker and focus on what youre doing for a change. you wont expire if you dont look at your phone for 36 seconds. great how people sit on a equipment gawping at their unimportant social media. plenty of benches and good showers. nice attitude from the members too.people are quite polite and no  i own the gym coz im bigattitudes.all gyms have peak busy times but i find winterhall very good for waiting times with my preferred times. enjoy,they make it a very smooth experience to join and enjoy. ps its a gym,not a social media cafe"
2,2023-08-19,Disappointing...,"i have been a member of a few pure gyms in edinburgh since 2012, so was looking forward to the gym opening in linlithgow.  it opened yesterday (18th august 2023) and i visited this morning.  a few issues i have:* 2 of my previous pure gyms in edinburgh were craigleith and gorgie.  both of these gyms are more than twice the size of linlithgow pure gym.  gorgie is £22.99 per month and craigleith is £25.99 per month, core.  linlithgow will be £25.99 per month core, after the 6 month promo of £14.99.  this is far too expensive for this size of gym in linlithgow and the surrounding areas. the new pure gym opening in falkirk in september 2023, will be £10.99 for the first 10 months and then £20.99 after that.  this will also be a larger gym.  £18.99 after the initial 6 months, would be a much more reasonable price for linlithgow.* whoever had the bright idea of facing all 6 treadmills towards a large white wall in a dark corner of the gym, has obviously never set foot on a treadmill!  no one wants to run or walk on a treadmill and have to stare at a wall.  please either add mirrors all along the wall to.give the illusion of looking out, whilst also being able to see into the gym behind you. or turn the treadmills around to face into the gym!* you have known this gym was opening for quite some time and yet, there were no materials to clean or wipe down the equipment after use.  weve only just come out of a pandemic. no one wants to have to use a piece of equipment thats covered in someone elses sweat!* the gym was boiling.  id rather it was warm than too cold, but either some air con or fans would be a very good idea, unless you want people passing out!* not enough weight benches.  3 weight benches for a gym is nowhere near enough.  this is a small gym, so i imagine on a monday evening, there will be a lot of people standing around, waiting  to use equipment.all of the above is very disappointing, especially given the amount of time that youve known this gym was opening and the amount of time weve all had to wait for it to open.  please can you sort all of the above out immediately. these are all issues which can be easily rectified.  if there have been no changes soon, then i definitely wont be returning and i know i wont be the only one!"
1,2023-08-19,"PureGym in Tower Park, Poole has a padlock issue.","i go to pure gym in tower park in poole and for weeks, the lockers in the womens changing room have been occupied with padlocks that women have left on there. the lockers are open but you cant use them because of the padlocks. i have tried to point this out to the staff, i have emailed the company but nothing has been done."
1,2023-08-17,The dirtiest gym in Stratford,"i took out a membership this week at pure gym stratford and to say i was disgusted is an understatement. this past week i use the gym from around 4:30am till 6:30am and i can not believe the state of a 6 month old gym. firstly when entering you can see protien powder on the floor near the entrance which on the first day i assumed must be recent but the exact same patch was there on thursday 3 days later and hadnt looked like it was cleaned. multiple machines have out of order signs on them which is fine whilst the gym is empty but for multiple machines to be out of service for 4 days seems extremely uncaring. typical gyms or any public space tend to be their cleanest in the mornings as cleaning usually takes place at the end of shifts in most businesses but shockingly ive seen the same opened cans of redbud, spilled protein powder, electrolyte drink bottle and various other food wrapper and drink items left around the gym day after day. id like to assume that the staff are doing their best but to see the same rubbish for 4 days repeatedly is astounding. the weights have never been easy to find wether im looking for a specific dumbbell or plate which is inconvenient but i can blame users of the gym over the staff in this case but to see weights left in the same place between days seems strange considering this gym should be busy.  the biggest issue with this gym by far is the mens changing rooms. i can not explain the full extent of its filth. the horrible smell is actual putrid, the toilet cubicles have immense amounts of dirty toilet paper on the floor around them, there are stains on the floor and benches and what looks like hair and snot in the showers. i can not understand how there is not daily cleaning with a business of this kind. and there no sanitary stations like in other gyms. its a shame as the pure gym in stratford seems to be affordable considering the rapid growth of the local area but this gym either needs to increase its price to starve the less respecting customers and allow the rest to value the gym more as well as providing cleaning equipment so members can clean after themselves. and there needs to be some sort of cleaning schedule as i can not comprehend why its in such a state. i honestly would rather have a refund of the month and joining fee because this is genuinely shocking. i very much expect a bs corporate response but action needs to be taken immediately."
4,2023-08-18,Much better,"so after my review on the 11th of august, i attended the gym today 18 august… the air con was working, was actually a pleasant temperature, the weights between 1kg to 10kg were all racked and organised!! the bigger weights are still all over the place, but you have to blame member mostly for a lack of due care to the surroundings, the place was actually far cleaner than last week, although the painted over bogie looked like its staying a permanent feature…. i’m not the type of person to go out of my way to moan about stuff, i’ll also give credit where credit is due… i did enter the men’s changing rooms for the 1st time in years, they smell awful, and the hair dryer isn’t working, the toilets were clean enough, and sharp bins in the men’s changing rooms which is actually a positive in my opinion, much safer then just thrown in the bin… all in all a much more positive experience,"
5,2023-08-01,Great Gym,"a very good gym, with loads of equipment and friendly helpful staff."
1,2023-08-17,Apalling customer engagement,"apalling customer engagement filthy changing rooms and showers completed by plugged up sinks a whole week in fareham no manager available. phone line only tells you no one available to talk send an email, tweet, or fb message. tweet this."
2,2023-08-18,Maintenance issues never resolved,"the gym is value for money but the upkeep of the facility is poor. the vibrating plate hasn’t worked in the 2 years i have been a member, the ski org machine is now broken and the bannister on the stairs is broken in 2 places with parts missing which could be a safety concern.  the disabled toilet is only available to use off peak and i noticed this morning the handle is coming loose again, last time this was closed for 2 weeks. these issues need to be addressed on an ongoing basis.  i have never seen any feedback box in 2 years so replying to reviews about seeing the manager is pointless as i use the gym in the early hours after work."
5,2023-08-17,Ify is an OUTSTANDING instructor,"ify is an outstanding instructor! her step class was energetic and fun. she made me feel welcomed in her class and i enjoyed every moment. it was great to see a non- judgemental lesson and everyone was being themselves! thank you ify, will be coming back to your step class!"

1,2023-08-16,Corner cutting & attitude,"started a class at wembley pure gym, bit chaotic initially as the trainer was late, i’m a 60 year old male with arthritis & scoliosis but still fit. i had previously done around 15 years of martial arts (30 years ago) both structured & unstructured but no matter where you train, in a boxing gym or a shack in thailand you always warm up & stretch else you can damage yourself. my arthritis in my shoulders is from the years of martial arts, my shattered right ankle still turns purple after i failed to warm up properly & wrecked it on a heavy bag. i assumed there was no warm up or stretch during the first class as the trainer was late & we were short of time but was oddly insistent on “hard & fast” on the punch & kick pads. i’d warmed up a bit anyway as i was early for the class but it was worrying to see absolute beginners attempting to kick a pad with their shin in full roundhouse & bashing away with their fists on the pads with no initial stretching. no time was spent on warm up or technique & if you are going to attempt any martial arts structured or not technique is what you learn before anything else else you will damage yourself. the second class i was late, no trains to wembley at the moment & the bus got stuck but i thought i’m only 5mins late so went into the class. so after some initial pad work the trainer started giving me a hard time as i was not fast & hard enough on the kick pad, fair enough but given the class history of both not warming up before attempting this & my arthritis & scoliosis (i’d flagged this with him during my first class) i thought i was doing well not to injure myself further. the issue is the trainer was raising his voice to the point that he wanted everyone to hear & there was an obvious attempt to embarrass me & then he started saying by me not making an effort i was effecting the partner i was sharing the kick pad with, that’s fine i thought but i am also aware that if i go hard & fast i can with no warm up also damage myself as i know from history. seconds later there was another rant about my apparent lack of effort & then about my lateness & that the class starts at 6pm & when the door is shut or whatever you don’t come in but as i say i missed the induction last time as the trainer was around 10mins late so as he’s raising his voice & it becomes pretty obvious that’s he’s just attempting to embarrass again i wanted to remind him that last time i attended he was late but at the time i thought these things happen. i said yeah sorry i was late & i wasn’t aware of your rules but i wanted to say actually you are a hypocrite & you need to practise what you preach, you rolled late into the class last time & no point did you say sorry about that. at that point i thought it was just easier to leave the class & so i did. the one star review is for the class i attended which i felt frankly was a little dangerous with its corner cutting, the rest of the gym is fine, clean & well resourced with good classes"
5,2023-08-17,Improved greatly in the past few months,"i had previously written a poor review in august 2023 complaining that the oxford cowley gym has gone noticeably downhill. the good news is that they listened to unhappy feedback and the gym has now really improved. its noticeably cleaner, the changing rooms no longer smell like a pet shop, the equipment is being much better maintained and staff are present on site. and if kit goes faulty, they now notice quickly and place out of order signs rather than frustrate users when something is not so obviously visibly broken.  i am pleased that i had some patience and remained a member. great turnaround - thanks!"
2,2023-08-16,Gym is pretty good for most equipment…,gym is pretty good for most equipment and is 24hrs. down side is that the gym is extremely busy at most times and is full of young students that hang around in groups. the showers are terrible as always dirty and hot water is hit and miss. locker room not equipped if u want to change/shower unless it’s extremely quiet.
1,2023-08-16,Main gym was Bristol Abbey Wood,"main gym was bristol abbey wood, if you work normal hours forget about trying to fit in a work before or after work, the gym is so oversold and unusable during 7-10am and 5-10pm. my final session at the gym i was asked by 3 different people on a machine i just got on how many sets i had left, which showcases how busy we are talking. i addressed concerns to gym manager prior leaving whose only suggestion was work out during other hours - not a possibility for most.  froze my membership online, it then mentioned the £6.99 to continue freezing, dont worry though puregym wont send you any emails or reminders about this and just charge you full price for multiple months instead when it finishes.  when you contact their support on twitter, the way you are meant to you will have some lacklustre response with no acknowledgment of previous loyalty or concerns about the gym that made you freeze it in the first place.  not sure what company in the modern world that doesnt send reminders but instead prays on you forgetting offering no refund despite not setting foot in the gym.  this was the last straw at considering keeping multiple gym contracts running to use pure when travelling but much better treatment at another gym and glad i have moved."

1,2023-08-07,Dirty Showers,"stark comparison - pure gym st georges leicester vs pure gym walnut street leicester.  how hard is it to have a safe, clean, warm shower? majority of the showers are either out of use (for over 2 months) or grubby, smelly and full of mold and germs. they alternate between very hot water and very cold water consistently.  doesnt matter which forum these issues are raised, direct to people in the gym, online or now here. these showers are becoming a public health concern.  can pure gym provide a full response on when these showers will be fixed. cleaned well and maintained (previously i have witnessed gym trainers pouring a cleaning solution into each shower. however this was before covid. its clear this has stopped due to the dirty and grime across the shower tray).  why can other pure gyms manage this well?"
3,2023-08-16,No Air conditioning.,"seems to be this issue again with air conditioning it’s on in parts of the gym but not in other parts and it becomes very uncomfortable to work in, main area i’ve noticed this is then the weights area, it gets stuffy with no air con. it’s been like this for well over a week now maybe longer."
1,2023-08-15,haverhill pure gym is corrupt,"why do all these staffs and shills reviews start off with a-licking then slip in some bitchy office remarks about a gym member that is irrelevant to this gym. a-licking and slipping in their true intent must be their way of life  you could look at dates and could read that they banded together and banned someones membership after they wrote 1 negative review about witnessing a pt do indecent stuff. they responded by telling everyone that the member did indecent behaviour, stripping and banned the member to avoid walking past them. what a bunch of cowards"

2,2023-08-15,Lack of maintenance,"ive been a puregym member for many years, i had a plus membership, so i can compare to other gyms, and now im based in camden with a simple membership. this gym could be much better with some maintenance. ive seen one of the stairs climbing machine broken for months, leaving only one. today i tried 3 treadmills before i found one that worked properly. one wouldnt start the running belt despite the screen working properly, one had faulty controllers, so speed and incline could be only managed through the screen, and so on. one of the bicycles had no pedal. its such a nice and big space, its a shame the maintenance is so poor.  edit 3/10/23: over 1 month after writing this, the stairs machine is still out of service. and the only one left, is always occupied. please, replace the other machine"
2,2023-08-15,Not an inclusive gym,"anne furby 21 reviews·5 photos a week ago new i actually enjoy this gym but unfortunately the owners dont care about their disabled customers. lift ""broke"" in december 2022 (the alarm doesnt work but the lift is still being used by staff to cart bin bags up from the lower ground)- its now april 17th 2023 and ive had no update whatsoever about when i might be able to return despite having reached out numerous times! this is at least the second time this has happened. the first time i was given access to two other gyms- one of which had a lift that was also broken and the other scarcely had room to walk through let alone navigate a wheelchair. do better or dont claim to be an inclusive gym! 🤷🏼‍♀️  edit- august 22nd 2023 and still no update re the lift! 👌🏻  edit- puregym i was notified that you replied to this review but there doesnt seem to be anything here..? 🤔 can you please give me the email to make a formal complaint, not for the shoreditch manager paul ive already emailed him about this issue numerous times with no joy. 👍🏻"
5,2023-07-31,It is a very good GYM.,"it is a very good gym. there is plenty of space to workout, different types of workout machines and the price is very affordable. also, loads of parking spots outside the gym. the only improvement that this gym needs is that the changing rooms need to be deep cleaned daily, especially the sinks, toilets, urinals and showers as most of times the bathrooms are not disinfected and reek very badly. other than this, the gym is great."

5,2023-08-15,Great gym,"i love this gym, it’s like a family. great atmosphere. great pts. i would recommend it to anyone. 10/10."
3,2023-08-08,After visiting some of the newer gyms…,"after visiting some of the newer gym locations such as coleraine and ballymena i can see that there are a number of improvements that could be made to the lisburn gym to offer the members better facilities especially in the functional area and weight training areas.  the list of suggestions is as follows: 1. install a track and sled, with the correct plates to load the sled made available in this area. 2. install a rack of blk box hex dumbbells in the functional area to offer dumbbell weights from 5kg to 22.5kg as is the case with the newer gyms. the current options only go as far as 10kg which is too light for a number of exercises that would be performed in this area. additionally the hex shape is much more suited for functional exercises than the circular ended dumbbells that lisburn currently has. 3. renovate the weight training area to install a blk box rig with weightlifting platforms like there is in the newer gyms. this would increase the number of people who can train at any one time. i acknowledge there is limited space in the venue but i believe that with some reorganisation this could be accommodated given that e.g. coleraine has all of the suggestions on my list and is working with a much smaller venue. 4. this is linked to point 3 - i suggest adding additional 15kg barbells and replacing/servicing the older barbells that lisburn currently have. in the newer gyms ive observed that there are usually 3 15kg belfast bars, and a good number of 20kg belfast bars and power bars, easily catering for everyone at the gym, whereas lisburn is quite limited in comparison. additionally there are not enough 5kg olympic lifting plates (only 1 pair) which is problematic if someone takes these away from the weight lifting platform. i suggest buying at least 1 new pair of these for the current situation, however if there was to be a rig installed plates would have to be bought in proportion to this. 5. add 2 concept bikes, to the functional area. ive noticed that lisburn only has the concept ski erg and rowers, however it would be a welcome addition to be able to have access to concept bikes here too. 6. the flooring in the functional area is spongey making it less stable that the flooring ive experienced elsewhere, and the area itself is quite small. i suggest that the area is refloored with the same material as in the newer gyms and the equipment rearranged to enable this area to cover a larger surface area.  thanks for taking the time to read my review, and i hope that in time all of the suggestions can be accommodated given this is the standard of equipment and facilities already being offered in the newer gyms."
1,2023-08-15,Stockport South - disgusting change/toilet facilities - not addressed after raising.,"despite raising the issue yesterday the male toilet facilities have not been addressed/cleaned. the only change has been one toilet cubicle has been blocked off. facilities check sheet has been replaced - mondays checks have been ‘completed’ however none of the tasks on the sheet have been physically completed - i took pictures on monday and again today - the sink area is a disgrace and all debris/water that was there monday is still present today - despite there being clear instruction on the check sheets for these to be removed - no gm or agm checks were completed yesterday either.  still water is a health hazard, i don’t pay my membership fee to be put at risk, nor does anyone else."
3,2023-08-14,Gym needs re organising,"gym needs re organising ,  the classes are held in a cage next to gym floor whitch the music and pts voice is way louder than gym floor music .  it may be better suited upstairs and bring the cardio machines down stairs where the class is being held now, 🤔"
5,2023-08-14,Fantastic Gym!,"love puregym folkestone.  i have been going ever since its first day.  it’s great place with its own great friendly little community, and because of this it has become my second home lol. i have gone from someone who was massively overweight and wouldnt go anywhere near a gym to someone who has developed a big passion for fitness, and has lost the fat and started to pack on muscle - something which i never thought would happen and i have truly astounded myself with this new passion.  gym lifer right here!"
4,2023-08-14,I love this gym,"i love this gym, i was struggling in my previous one due to lack of spaces and machine but eastgate is big and well equipped, never waited once to use a machine. and i love the big window facing outside when you’re on treadmill. only thing i would improve,is the cleaning, im not sure if is due to lack of staff…but i really need a clean station where i can get at list paper and antibacterial to clean the machine before i sit on it. if you guys can provide that i would definetly give a 5 star ⭐️"
5,2023-08-14,Best gym in Holborn area,i love this gym and i really enjoy the classes. special thanks to laura who always makes workouts fun! she knows how to motivate you and you really feel like you workout after her classes!
5,2023-08-14,Great gym with friendly and welcoming…,great gym with friendly and welcoming staff who always greet you. classes are varied and fun. only negative is recently gym users are leaving weights on machines and bars. this is confusing as you don’t know if the equipment is free to use and dangerous to those who may struggle to move heavy weights.
1,2023-08-14,Awful car access,awful car access. i just bought a fresh membership and after circling near the gym i wasn’t able to get to it due to the road works. awful. there’s simply no way of getting to the gym by car if you’re coming from dartford. awful. awful. awful
3,2023-08-14,Go for equipment only,"weights and equipment ok but very disappointed in the atmosphere of this fitness centre from both fitness enthusiasts and workers. just because youre more experienced in the gym doesnt mean you are better than everyone else and can look down on others.  even personal trainers who have a duty of care leave juvenile comments which fully name pure gym members from their customer database. these members may or may not even be involved but is a desperate attempt to aimlessly libel gymgoers that arent paying clients. the reviews write that they stink, do indecent behaviour, harass women and derogatory comments on their body and how theyre insecure etcetera, the typical unoriginal allegations that online commenters do to make you think theyre a pedo or something. the reviews also contain concrete allegations which the workers are the only ones actually doing, so this sounds more like projection. the worse ones have been deleted to hide them but the workers accidently exposed themselves already.  the same clients who monopolize the equipment for their pricey sessions also leave many reviews for their trainer. mostly about being obese and just started their journey and wouldve given up without the support of their friend. but based what ive seen, some trainers have no genuine friendliness or consideration for both clients or gymgoers other than the consideration of profiteering them for money and social status.  while the centre looks okay the personal training at pure gym at haverhill is not recommend by me for these reasons."
1,2023-08-12,OK so my negative reviews have been…,ok so my negative reviews have been removed by trustpilot.  must be a corporate thing.
3,2023-08-09,Cold showers,"positives - good variety of classes, staff generally friendly and approachable plenty of cardio equipment, bit lacking upstairs with some of the weights and some of the machines eg leg extension only 1 available negatives - air conditioning no longer as cool so often sweating before a class even starts, particularly in our warmer climate. showers even colder than before, if i was at home having to take showers in those temps id know id forgotten to put the water heater on, absolutely ridiculous. cant wait until the usual winter weather where the changing rooms are always freezing, and now u can have a complimentary cold shower to boot. obviously a money saving exercise rather than anything else, however need to sort it out as theyre making plenty of money from.members who now cant even have a warm shower.  if you like warm showers, particularly in the winter, go elsewhere. if you like lukewarm showers in a cold changing room in the middle of december this is the place to be"
1,2023-08-09,Very dirty and impersonal gym,"im shocked there are so many good reviews for this gym as it isnt clean and i find the staff are not on hand to help when you need them, they seem to hide away in the office or they are with clients doing pt. i never been to a gym where the staff seem so disinterested. there have been 2 new pts (female) that have joined recently who are chatty and make more of an effort but the rest of the team never speak to members and help with form etc. the gym is dated and very dirty. just because its cheaper then some other gyms doesnt mean standards should slip. i have cancelled my membership after being a member for 2 years today and have joined another gym that is immaculate and slightly better on price."
5,2023-08-12,"Lovely, all inclusive and friendly gym.","this is a lovely, all inclusive and friendly gym that encourages everyone to do their best, learn something new and grow in confidence at your own pace.  its so nice to have a safe, clean and comfortable place to be able to decompress and reach goals. the managers and the staff here are very nice, genuine and helpful people who are all clearly passionate about your goals. staff are always approachable and friendly if you need help on how to use something or are trying something new.  its a shame to see some reviews with negative connotations attached to certain staff as that definitely isnt a true reflection of experiences here, nor their characters. this appears more of a personal problem that needs to be addressed externally.  i use the showers often due to being a night nurse and working out pre shift, they are always clean and respected which is a nice bonus, and you dont often have to wait to use one.  the classes are buzzing everyday and very popular. the app makes it easy to book on too.  i have used a pt since joining pure gym, chantelle has been such a positive influence on my fitness journey. we work together to push through limitations on all aspects of fitness and i look forward to coming to the gym for our sessions as i always leave feeling so much better. the other staff are also great at motivating you and making sure youre alright.  overall there is nothing negative to say about this gym, been here nearly a year and never had any problems. its an environment where you can reach your goals steadily and consistently.  it takes time to find your feet if youve never been to a gym before (as i hadnt before november) but everyday gets easier."
3,2023-08-08,I like the gym but it is too hot,"i like the gym but it is too hot, especially the studio where there was no working air conditioning on. it’s too hot to workout comfortably. a number of the locks on the womens shower cubicles are broken too and you can’t close the doors properly."
5,2023-08-09,Good so far,"so far my daughter is enjoying comeing to pure gym,  weve only come during quite time due to her sensory issus. she happy the music never too loud for her, and she feels comfortable walking round doing her workout. the member of staff my daughter spoke too was approachable an nice to talk to and it eased my daughter with her anxiety"
1,2023-08-12,Showers are always stone cold or the…,showers are always stone cold or the boiler is broke… don’t waste your money on dated equipment and freezing showers. if they can’t even give their users a nice hot shower on a clean environment after a workout there’s something seriously wrong. save your money and join gym group or one of the other gyms in plymouth. i’ve been saying about the shower for months now and enough is enough. i’m cancelling my membership and joining a gym that actually takes care of its member needs. just trying to save money about seriously putting gym users backs up. the gym is meant to be an activity to take me away from stress and the trap world. i don’t come to the gym for dirty disgusting changing rooms and freezing showers.
1,2023-08-12,Showers in female changing were…,showers in female changing were absolutely filthy there is no way they had been cleaned in am sure at least a day or two!!! was closed when we got there this morning albeit temporarily however the girl we met at the door to enquire was incredibly rude!!! would add the photo of the shower but seemingly unable to on here.
5,2023-08-11,Puregym Crewe,moved to puregym from lifestyle centre and i have to say it’s amazing! highly recommend it. the equipment seems to be a lot more challenging compared to the one at lifestyle centre and the overall atmosphere is great as you can see people go there to actually workout and not hangout with friends like it was the case at lifestyle centre and you had to wait around to do your workouts or couldn’t do them at all.
1,2023-08-11,Solicited/fake testimonies,posse of low lives covering each others backs with a sudden barrage of solicited/fake reviews by pretending to be members of the general public. scroll down and youll see the blatant misconduct and questionable accusations they are desperately trying to cover up. i havent even been to this gym yet but i am reviewing based on my online experience so far.
3,2023-08-08,The gym facilities are largely…,"the gym facilities are largely excellent all the machines are new and the gym area is clean and tidy. gym has a nice feel and atmosphere.  there are however issues with the men’s showers. of the 6/7 cubicles most don’t have locking mechanisms that work severely limiting how many can shower at once. meaning on my last visit i had to leave without being able to shower. in addition the temperature control of the showers don’t work, they’re stiff and hardly move so post workout you end up sweaty from a hot shower.  i have raised this with management and i’ve been told it’s been logged. unfortunately 3 weeks after opening the issue is still prevalent and is disappointing that is still difficult to use gym facilities. you’d have thought this would have been resolved prior to opening or at the very least shortly after opening."
5,2023-08-09,"Came in for info, now a member","came in the other day, spoke to the pts and was really surprised how informative they were. the place is clean and tidy, the equipment looked in good condition. only came in looking for information and i’m now a member and have booked with on of the pts for next week! excited to start my journey, so thanks everyone for the reassurance"

1,2023-08-11,I DON'T RECOMMEND,"the worst gym in the city, no hot water, broken and faulty equipment, one working mens toilet for 6,000 memberships, the staff is lazy, they only talk among themselves, i do not recommend."

1,2023-08-10,"Unreliable instructors, unreliable classes, and unreliable temperature","unreliability is how i would describe my experience with this gym: you book a class and its suddenly cancelled or you book with an instructor and they change.... theres no instructors coverage so when many are absent in summer and xmas hols the experience is unsatisfactory the aircon is a huge prob for me, sometimes it works but again not consistently. if you go to train upstairs and youre not under a vent youre stewing like a frog in hot water im not a fan anymore."
1,2023-08-01,TrainSafe? ShowerSafe?,"most of the showers are out of action. ones that are open are moldy in the shower tray and the ceiling is showing lots of green mould. the water goes from extremally cold to burning hot. the shower heads also have some weird fan on them to blow the water on you with cold air. all of which results in a terrible shower experience. i invite gym management to try shower in them. instead of looking at them at afar. especially all the grime and mold. come on pure gym, you constantly   preach about ""trainsafe"" gym cleanliness and hygiene - maybe  you should introduce ""showersafe"" a clean and safe place to shower.  the mold specifically is concerning. is it safe? is it bacteria ? a breading group for ecoli ? legionnaires? i expect more from a leading gym name in the uk, its not a back street gym after all!"
5,2023-08-09,Great gym with huge variety of…,"great gym with huge variety of equipment & classes. open 24/7 with free parking. the managers chlo & estin are friendly & approachable & both teach a great class themselves. it’s somewhere i feel comfortable & safe & i’ve met a lovely group of people with the same goals as me. classes with jaimie, james, ali & lauren are fun & challenging with a special mention to ash whose persistent encouragement has pushed me to achieve more than i thought i could already. i’d recommend this gym to anyone"
2,2023-08-09,Year later and the app still crashes…,year later and the app still crashes everyday. you have the longest intro to get onto the app and it’s a waste of time. i got stuck in the gym for 10 mins extra the other day because the app wouldn’t load and the internet connection was bad inside so couldn’t find the email with my code. oh and of course no staff were there to help (is there ever!?)
1,2023-08-09,Assistant Manager at London Wall Puregym Very RUDE!!,"i was at puregym (london wall site) on the morning of 9th aug 2023 and after 2hrs of working out i decided to cool down on the treadmill just doing a brisk walk.  one of the pg staff team who claim she is the manager, walked up to me and said i must put my bag away because it was health & safety. i said to her, i have been here for 2hrs now, so i am just cooling down for 10mins and i am done, before i knew what was happening i went back on the treadmill, the staff member said to me again, can you put your bag away now!  i again explained to her, i heard you, and i am aware of what you are asking, but i only need 10mins on the treadmill and i am done. she interrupted me again and was quite aggressive and insisting i put my bag away immediately!!! i got off the treadmill and said to her, my bag is not obstructing anyone and is practically nothing inside, the staff member got very defensive and said i was rude to her, i asked her, how am i being rude to you? she said i was frowning at her!!! next thing i knew what was happening she said something else (couldnt hear her due to the loud music) and then she stomped off.  i just want to make this clear i am aware of the no bags on gym floor policies, but i merely forgot to lock it away this morning and bought my bag on the gym floor. the staff member stated she is the manager, i am actually shocked to hear she is the manager and spoke to the members in that tone  i felt it was not what she said to me, but how she spoke to me, if she is the manager she should know very well as “good customer services” you don’t talk to your members like this, in fact you dont talk to anyone like this, i felt she spoke to me as if i was a stupid child in a playground! i am 51 years of age and i am aware of health & safety, i work for the nhs as a business manager so i appreciate she does not talk to the members as if they are some silly naughty child in a school classroom, does she speaks to her staff like that? she sounded like if i did not do it straight away as i am told, or i will get a slap!!!  what i am trying to said is, you will get members not always going to focus on the health & safety i.e. putting weights back or not to take bags or belongings onto gym floor, we all have busy life and not always aware of what we are doing, we just want to come to the gym do our training and leave. she could have just give me a little reminder and left it at that, and if i did this again, yes of course i agree there will be a warning, however don’t talk to me as if i am a stupid naughty child in a classroom, i did not appreciate it and i am sure no one want to be spoken to the way she did.  and for her to get defensive saying i was rude by frowning at her is just for her to attack me first, because she wanted the last words. i joined the whole of pgs (£54 a month) to use all the uk pg over a month ago so i can have the options to use other sites too, i do not pay this much to have some silly staff talk to me like i am stupid, frankly i felt harass and provoke by her, and pg is supposed to put a stop to harassment, this is a joke! puregym promote harrassment not preventing it""! puregym london wall deserve ""0"" star, i only use london wall site it 2 - 3 times a week because i work in the city! i go to other sites ( greenwich, kidbrooke, beckton etc and i never had any issues) this has left me feeling very vulnerable and quite anxious and at the same time i felt harass by her, but i am not going to allow this person make me feel harass or ruin my day."
5,2023-08-09,Very clean,"very clean, tidy gym. staff are very friendly"
2,2023-08-08,For the most part the gym is great,"for the most part the gym is great, plenty of machines and free weights, quiet if you avoid the obvious peak hours and the staff have always been helpful and pleasant on the occasions ive needed to speak to them.  the problem is the temperature, its been an issue every summer for years. its like an oven, im sweating before i even leave the changing room. after a workout i cant cool down enough even after showering for ages and i was on the verge of passing out doing cardio yesterday which has spurred me on to write this. its the same every year, plenty of people mention it to the staff and im sure they raise it up the chain but nothing ever seems to happen. last year they brought in free standing ac units which helped for a few months but this year, nothing.  please dont give the standard response of the smart monitors controlling the temperature. if there is then they are clearly broken, set far far to high or the air con units arent up to the job. its that bad when work colleagues have asked about joining ive put them off explaining the above. it really isnt good enough for the most expensive puregym in the country."

1,2023-08-06,Dirty,dirty. found used blue roll on the floor and chewing gum on the treadmills. ladies changing room had a bad smell not happy with this place for the piece wouldnt recomend.
5,2023-08-08,Be careful of fake reviews on here,"unfortunately, a very insecure and hurt little lad keeps making fake accounts and harassing the puregym staff due to being rightfully banned from the gym. make sure when looking at reviews, you take into account the only bad reviews use the same awful grammar and questionable plastic londoner words. great gym, great staff, great members who are not banned for the correct reasons."
4,2023-08-08,Just a few things….,"hi,  been using this gym for a few months and it has fantastic facilities. there are just a few things i’d like to see improved. 1) change all the barbell clips to the plastic brackets. the metal ones get bent out of shape easily quite quickly and scratch the bar. the plastic ones are quicker when loading and cleaner and easier to use 2) a sled for the functional fitness area 3) a bike erg, as the bike we currently have keeps breaking 4) yanga water for the vending machine (yum!)"
5,2023-08-07,Best gym I’ve ever been to I’m so glad…,"best gym i’ve ever been to i’m so glad i joined!  dan la sala - the pt, is amazing there! so friendly, introduced me to loads of people to make friends and is amazing at training me - would strongly recommend him!  great over-all vibe, really enjoy coming :)"
2,2023-08-07,Too busy most of the time,"i’ve been a member here since it opened. sadly, it’s just got far too busy. decent equipment, just not enough of it. extremely busy and noisy most of the time. i’ve just been there on a monday afternoon and given up. there’s no point. trying to do anything takes so long. a quick hour in there is now impossible. evenings and saturday mornings are ridiculous. can’t access any of the machines. free weights area far too crowded. they only have two standard upright exercise bikes. it seems like they’ve taken on too many members for the size of the gym."
5,2023-08-07,Classes,"shout out for classes led by carter cohen. organises his classes in advance, works round all muscle groups, clear timings, explanations, good variety of exercises."
3,2023-08-06,Was about to join today,"was about to join today, but read the reviews on the parking issues at the gym,  how puregym have used a dodgy car maintenance company. these companies are a joke, it’s all about trying to make as much money out of motorists. any gym using these rouge companies on their customers is not something i want to be part off."
5,2023-08-06,I swim up at Knaresborough pool and I…,i swim up at knaresborough pool and i was need the gym side as well as i was having difficulty training at home. great staff and great atmosphere.
1,2023-08-04,Go elsewhere!!!!,"after being a member of this gym on and off for a number of years i can safely say i wouldn’t go back. the gym equipment is old and outdated, and broken.  there appears to be less weight plates and there is clearly no investment pushing people away. the gym is full of teenagers who just hang around and don’t do much apart from talk and mess about.  the staff are clueless and there appears to be a high turn over of staff which doesn’t help. i have raised the issues regarding equipment numerous times to the gym manager and head office and i get the same standard corporate boring answer, which no doubt will be posted again. i would suggest that you invest in the gym and bring it up to the standard of the other pure gyms local to runcorn or just close it. in short, it’s dreadful."
2,2023-08-05,Cardio kit issues,"the new cardio kit isnt up to the job. the upright bikes so small and cramped they are really unusable. i am only 61"" but even with the saddle at maximum extension i cant extend legs nearly enough to ride comfortably. the handlebars are far too wide and theres no fan unlike the old ones which were much better. they have no screens but i can live with that. there are no spin bike alternatives either that i could see. on to the treadmills they also have issues. doing an interval session to change speed quickly you have to use a tiny keypad. there are no big buttons to change speed quickly. its really awkward. again the fan has gone. the rowing machines are concept 2s which are normally great & quality kit but these ones badly need a service. the chains are all rough and make them unpleasant to use. i get that its a budget gym but this is really cutting too many corners. its too basic for any kind of serious training. please please please do not install this stuff at any of your other gyms. it is a deal breaker for me. i would rather pay an extra quid or two a month and get something a bit better."
1,2023-08-04,"Without any notification, close gym","hi i’m a finchely branch member. i do use the gym early in the morning , yesterday ( 4/8/2023 ) i went to gym and saw this gym is closed without any notification or email . how you are planning to notify your schedule for your member ? please let me know the opening times or whether you are going to reopen the gum soon ? thanks"
2,2023-08-05,Small and overpriced,i joined this gym when it first opened due to the discounted memberships available. i left due to health reasons and also because i found it very small and was waiting around for machines during busy times. i just looked at costs to restart the membership compared to other gyms and was shocked to see how much it is and don’t think it’s worth it considering how small it is.
5,2023-08-01,Love the classes,"love the classes, thanks to harry, jamie, eddie and jelena great instructors the gym could do with a bit of a refurb, but all in all great gym and very friendly staff and people"

1,2023-07-04,Keep changing classes and times,"keep changing classes and times, less and less evening spinning classes  for people who finish work after 5.30 - 6 are not being catered for really poor not enough instructors seriously thinking about stopping my membership, this gym used to be amazing with lots of different classes and great instructors what has gone wrong !!!"
1,2023-06-04,Worst payment system,worst payment system . fully crowded .no trainer advise.
2,2023-08-01,Wouldn't recommend,"joined 3 weeks ago. been cornered by personal trainers trying to flog their services, (while im trying to work out) asking highly personal questions ""do you have any health conditions?""! also, classes get cancelled last minute if theyre not enough people, so you end up making the journey for nothing. cheap but you get what you pay for."
5,2023-08-04,Ace Gym: Happy Member,the gym is fantastic. it has great parking considering the size. the equipment is great and always in great working order as well as the staff being attentive and respectful and good fun.
1,2023-08-04,Targeted by manager!,"targeted by manager!  i just finished three-sets of deadlifts and went to refill my water-bottle.  when i returned to do a fourth set, another gym-member asked if i had finished with the weights and i said yes, so he took them.  i then proceeded to the preacher station and did some curls.  when i turned my back the manager started putting my weights away and i said - excuse me, i have not finished with these weights.  this statement angered him somewhat and his response was to say - ""well i could be cruel and tell you to put the weights you left on the floor away"" - weights id already given to somebody else!  i then had to re-clip the ez-bar as he skulked off.  when i left the gym, i approached the manager and told him that the other gym member took ownership of the weights and he might want to check his cctv before wrongly accusing me of leaving the weights lying around.  he completely ignored me and walked off without apologising or saying anything.  to the manger. your attitude stinks.  perhaps consider that the revenue generated by puregym members helps to pay your salary and your co-workers salary!!!  due to this experience, im canceling my membership and going to another gym.  disclaimer. im a little inconsistent with putting weights away but on this instance, i was not at fault."
2,2023-08-01,"Busy, busy and busy!","busy, busy, busy it is hard to get a routine with machines being taken up. some of the machines are faulty. i kept finding ones that were just beat up. one more point, the cardio room is dull with nothing to look at but the wall. it appears the place needs about double the space and better machines."
2,2023-07-31,Poor customer service at the London Finchley Branch,"i go regularly to puregym london finchley and i enjoy the classes very much.  unfortunately i work during the day (9am-5pm) and i really struggle to go to my pilates class in the mornings (i am on calls).  today i decided to pop into the new managers office and ask if it was possible to have pilates classes in the afternoon or evening at any point in the future.  the manager seemed to be offended by the suggestion and she took it personally. i apologized if i caused any stress and i ended up giving up because there was no way to reason with her.  before i left her office i explained that to my regret, i might need to change to another gym that has pilates classes when i finish work. i tried to help her to understand that i am spending too much money in extra classes at other places i thought that this information would calm her down but it made it worse.  to my surprise, when i left her office, she slammed the door behind me. unbelievable! i am still in shock.  i have been a puregym customer for many years but already cancelled my membership because i prefer to go to a more customer friendly gym."
1,2023-08-04,Major health and safety concern,i don’t understand why people are not being honest in their reviews. this gym is not fit for purpose and is a major health and safety concern. firstly the roof is seriously compromised it has been shut for major leaks due to rain fall numerous times. this should have been thoroughly checked before acquiring the premises. in terms of gym quality the premises is far too small and can’t keep up with demand. i don’t think this place will last because of health and safety/building regulations.
5,2023-08-03,After a challenging week at work going…,"after a challenging week at work going to the gym is one of the few moments of respite i get is in the gym, chlo, estin, jamie, ash and james have made puregym taunton into a haven for us all. patiently supporting me on both my good days and bad they have made what used to be a chore (at previous gyms) into an absolute pleasure. with challenging classes, clean equipment and lovely staff i cant ask for more, im so glad i signed up when they opened."
1,2023-08-01,The blond PT the large one keep leaving…,the blond pt the large one keep leaving equipment all around when we are meant to put them a way while she dont all she does is films clients while im in back ground without asking me or anyone else. she keeps plastering her half naked pics around showing her her birthing scars is safe space yet doesn’t feel like it yet man cant do that the manager clearly allows woman to be under dressed while man have to wear thee right gear. the manager clearly favours woman and allows them to do what they want but is ride to us pure gym should be represented by a fit polite coach not some insecure predator
2,2023-07-13,Do you even have air con,"not enough barbells - the 12” soft box is nowhere to be found, and the temperature indicates there is no aircon.  i don’t understand how you can charge so much."

1,2023-07-31,What a complete and utter JOKE,"what a complete and utter joke.  brought my daughter gym membership at the aylesbury branch recently for her 16th birthday i tried with zero success to get hold of a phone number for the gym or head office with a couple of questions prior.  absolutely no number exists. you can not speak to a single person!  foolishly i brought the membership anyway.  my daughter registered and was given a code online to access the gym.  turned up for the first time, tried the correct code multiple times and of course it didnt work.  she was let in by a cleaner.  there are absolutely no reception/office staff.i then contacted this company via facebook messenger (its the only way) i explained the situ received  a reply  a day or 2 later.   i sent them another message to clarify the exact issue with code-nearly 3 days later absolutely no response from them!  my daughter attended the gym again today with the hope there may be staff on duty and she could perhaps gain access.  no on both counts. what a complete and utter s..t show. avoid at all costs.in short zero access, zero phone calls taken, practacally zero replys to messages?!?!"

3,2023-08-03,Staff are all lovely,"staff are all lovely. but im perplexed that there are no cleaning stations at all? and no cycle studio? it seems like most of the lower floor is dedicated to weights, benches, squat racks. what about the cardio queens? :) only a few isolated bikes i can see. please bring in a spin studio and some cleaning stations."
5,2023-08-03,Joined 6 months ago when my previous…,"joined 6 months ago when my previous gym closed and i’m delighted with my choice. well equipped, clean and a tidy with a nice but still serious vibe. the senior management sam and andrea are particularly friendly and always offer a welcome 👍"
1,2023-08-01,Badly maintained equipment,"i had been a member of this gym for a while and then left as life got in the way. i recently rejoined and realised its gone down hill. the equipment is not maintained as it should be, the exercise bikes crunch when you pedal and the rowing machines (most) need the seats re securing as you feel them move when you are in mid row. im very disappointed as it seems nothing is being done to maintain the equipment. would you please let me know in your reply the exact dates you will check every piece of machinery and see that it is repaired or replaced if necessary? its the same with the regent street location. i am considering going to either jd gyms or the gym group as i looked around those gyms and the equipment is in much better condition."
5,2023-07-31,Great gym,"really enjoy going to pure gym lichfield, new to the area and joined alone. staff are really friendly and supportive in the group exercise classes. step class by ellie is amazing, this is the longest i have attended a gym."

5,2023-08-02,Good quality gym overall,"good quality gym overall, friendly and helpful staff. i have attended a few classes with pete, killer sessions but very enjoyable and left each one feeling great. pete is good at engaging/motivating when you feel like giving up and does most of the exercises with the group. highly recommend attending one of his classes."
2,2023-08-02,The state of the showers in this Gym…,"the state of the showers in this gym are unhygienic and utterly disgusting, regardless of timing they are dirty and full of pubes. i have showered early morning and evening and they never appear to be properly cleaned"
5,2023-07-05,Amazing personal  trainers!!,amazing personal trainers!!! every and each class is so amazing and motivating to attend! staff are always very helpful.
5,2023-08-01,Dave helped me achieve my Goals,"one of my goals at the beginning of the year was to become more physically fit by losing weight, building muscle, and toning my body. to achieve this, i began working out at pure gym skydome. it was there that i met dave, an amazing personal trainer who has helped me tremendously over the past six months. dave not only guided me through my gym workouts, but also provided detailed instructions on my diet, step tracking, calorie counting, and macro calculations - including protein, fat, carbohydrate, and fibre intake - on a daily basis. by strictly following his advice, i have successfully lost 10 kilograms and gained a lot of muscle mass, as well as increased stamina, strength, and flexibility. if you are looking to transform your physique and become more fit, i highly recommend dave as a personal trainer."
1,2023-07-31,RUBBISH  BORED  STAFF,"rubbish  bored  staff,      try to bully  customers avoid  this"
1,2023-08-01,Booked my first class walked all the…,booked my first class walked all the way to the gym to be told that the class was cancelled. no one told me to check my app before attending class. pure gym should text people to keep them up to date.
1,2023-07-31,Broken music equipment,went to a step class on monday at 5:30. music system was broken. the instructor attempted to use a portable speaker but connection was weak. only did 3 routines in 45 minutes because the equipment kept failing. the instructor was very apologetic and tried his best to get the equipment to work.
4,2023-08-01,Relatively Good Gym no matter where you go,"relatively good gym across the country however not a great app for editing personal information. it can be a nightmare to sort out changing payment dates or upgrading or anything around that sort. i know how to do it just too many restirctions not flexiable enough.  for a company that doesnt have a solid call centre to speak to someone instantly, day or night it is a problem. it is a shame as i have been with puregym for years but they need less restictions on dealing with your membership such as ( waiting 7 days or 4 days before paydates before editing details)"
3,2023-08-01,Mixed feelings,"good facilities with a good number of branches. regular classes although these are generally of a low intensity (i presume to be more inclusive), those with higher level of fitness may not find them challenging enough.  the flavoured water is sickly and should be avoided.  some dubious business practices that are classic for a lot of gyms - the cancel membership webpage doesnt work and when you email them to cancel they say you must cancel the direct debit directly with your bank. clearly a tactic to get another few months from those less confident or able to action that."
2,2023-08-01,whilst the gym is clean and spacious,"whilst the gym is clean and spacious, some equipment is not working and has not been repaired for some time, including the calf machine and now both sets of cables.   some equipment is starting to presents as dated and many of the rubber covers over handles are no longer in place.  air conditioning is often not on.   there seems to be a lack of priority and urgency toward its users to get equipment repaired and to be at the standard it should be."
1,2023-07-31,Spin bikes in a very poor state of disrepair.,"attended a spin class this evening. once again, numerous bikes are broken and worn and not maintained as they should be.  some aspects of disrepair are in fact dangerous and a health and safety issue. i decided to leave the class 5 minutes in due to having to exercise on a hideous bike with numerous faults.  the gym instructor iain is excellent and always runs a brilliant class. however, he is constantly let down by poor management who never seem willing, or able to repair and service these spin bikes in the expected and proper manner.  this issue has been reported numerous times previously. they have a little purge of attention before another cycle of disrepair commences. puregym really fail in this area which is a massive shame and disappointment."
3,2023-07-31,The classes generally are great but the air con is terrible,"the classes generally are great. glad to see the lockers are getting sorted out now, and the general cleanliness has improved following the last few months of it being pretty grim at times. i am told the air con is working and has been fixed, although i find this difficult to believe as the temperature in the gym means you start sweating before you have even started your work out!! be honest … has it just been turned down/ switched off as i don’t ever remember it being so hot in this gym…ever. i have brought this up a few times and starting to feel fobbed off!"
1,2023-07-02,Unhygienic place to workout,very good gym. but the hygiene levels in this place is vile. i have been going for a month raised various machines being faulty and a whole month later they still broke. i have even seen there to be a piece of rubbish and a pen next to a machine for over 1 month ?. the cleaners essentially pretend to clean which i have noticed alot.
1,2023-04-19,Some of your PT’s have created a toxic…,some of your pt’s have created a toxic gym environment to the point where i and some of my friends have felt too uncomfortable going to the gym.  on top of that i received emails that my account has bounced and therefore would need to re apply - i opted to not rejoin due to the message above but have now noticed that my account is still being charged even though i do not have access to the gym as my password to enter doesn’t work
5,2023-07-30,EASILY the best gym in its class in MK,"easily the best gym in its class for price per month, facilities, open space, availability and clientele in all of milton keynes. and i know because i road-tested every main gym in mk with a 1-day pass before committing to a membership at any of them.  some muppet further down this list of reviews gave pure winterhill a 1 star and said ""awful. jd gyms next door is better"". no, it absolutely isnt.  well, it is if you like kiddie ""music"" blaring at 400db in a dimly lit warehouse, where all the benches are screwed to the floor so you cant move them, and a ridiculous entry/exit system. and where the average member age is 14 and clearly all their workouts are copied from the latest idiotic instagram post. i tried jd out and it is absolutely god-awful.  not at pure gym; the clientele are older, know what theyre doing better (especially with heavy weight), and the range of equipment is broader and there is more of it. the lighting is better (more natural daylight) and the staff are more congenial. having said that, many of them simply mill around and dont even make eye contact when i walk past, despite having been a member for years. but since im not there for idle chit-chat that doesnt ultimately bother me and staff members like eddy and danielle more than make up for it.  a proper sealing door system means the inside temp remains ambient even on the hottest and coldest days of the year.  in 2021 they replaced their entire dumbbell weights from lowest to highest and in 2022 they had a full redecoration and refurb. just recently in june-july they have been replacing the overhead lamps to create a ""warmer"" light at floor level.  my only niggle is that they recently removed their set cleaning stations, which customers used to sanitise equipment, however i believe theyve done that to minimize paper towel waste. so its a trade-off.  its just over a tenner per month for a well-stocked commercial gym with good all-round facilities and plenty of space, light and air. dont like any of those things? please do go sign up somewhere else...please, i encourage it."
1,2023-07-31,No air flow,"no air flow, the temperature is set to 21c. the first day i asked if they could lower it as that is hotter than most peoples houses! the first person said they would ask as then didnt know how, this never happened and had a horribly warm session. today i asked the manager if it could be lowered and he told me its set to 21c so no! before pure gym the places gym had a much better temperature to work out.  i cant recommend the stale warm gym at crystal peaks, sheffield. if you want a casual chat and a cuppa then it could be the right environment, but for most people i have spoken to its way to warm, sort this out pure gym. 16c would be an ample temperature, who wants to work out in a warm house heat! also good thinking putting carpet down, lovely to absorb all the sweat from the poor people dripping all over the place. on that note, there are also no cleaning stations, so unless you bring your own dettol wipes, you are going to be lying in lots of stale sweat."

3,2023-07-30,Needs a deep clean,"started the gym when it first opened, over time the cleanliness of the gym has gone down hill especially in the changing rooms/showers/toilets.  went this morning and all the showers are thick with excess dried in soap scum, pubes and sock fluff; keep in mind i went at 5 am and supposedly the gym changing rooms get locked and cleaned during 12-3am.  could also do with wipes after people have used gym equipment too.  going to give it another week or so but may try other gyms."
3,2023-07-29,Overall a large selection of equipment…,"overall a large selection of equipment but sadly it’s let down by annoying faults. showers are freezing cold (yes i’ve read your comments about “carbon footprint” but as a consumer paying for a product i don’t care about that. if paying i’d like a warm shower). the hair dryers are just pathetic, you’ve got more chance drying your hair under the hand dryers. the tannoy staff shout over is extremely annoying, be professional and go talk to someone doing something wrong. my first interaction with a member of staff was also an unhelpful one which isn’t great for first impressions, especially when it involves a faulty product i’ve spent money on. sanitation stations are either empty or broken and just look tatty. fix these points and it’s well worth the £22.99 a month. 👍🏻"
2,2023-07-27,Dirty showers and toilets,"dirty showers and toilets, water not hot. average gym, it’s good for the money but nothing special. average and cheap gym."
3,2023-07-29,first time at this gym,"first time at this gym, decent kit but locker room facilities need work, half the showers broken and water everywhere from a broken toilet, not ideal."

4,2023-07-29,Awesome experience,"so i had my ""get started"" class today and it was an excellent experience.  i have social anxiety and i am an absolute beginner at the gym, so was extremely nervous but the staff did a great job to make the group feel welcomed and comfortable, happily answered all questions, and gave great advice and how to use the equipment. despite my nervousness, i did stick around after the class for about 15 mins to try out some of the equipment.  the gym itself looked clean and tidy, with plenty of room for people, though i couldnt say what busier times will feel like (my class was at 8:30 am so it was not as busy). the only reason for the 4 stars was that some of the lockers were without padlocks along with what looked like one or two with broken doors.  other than that, i feel like it will be a great place to continue to go to for my own health and fitness journey."

3,2023-07-28,"Fix the air conditioning, but otherwise a great gym","great gym with genuinely amazing staff, but the temperature and humidity in the gym over the last few months with the warmer weather is truly unpleasant and, at times, unbearable. the air conditioning is not set cold enough and the staff arent allowed to make it colder. this is ruining an otherwise perfect gym experience."

1,2023-07-28,PureGym BCC need to step up their game and protect their members!,"i have been a member of this gym for 6 years now. for 5/6 years the green track has been out of use and covered up by a temporary (although it’s pretty permanent) wall. there are always the orange barricades somewhere in the gym whether that be by the functional area on one side of the rig so reducing the space that is available for all members or elsewhere in the gym. now every time i go in, i’m not at all surprised by the machines having the “out of order” sign on them because it has become the norm for this gym. it never gets a permanent fix just a temporary one which lets be honest never lasts long. what i was shocked and surprised by the other day when i was in the gym, was that the emergency buttons weren’t working and there was a sign next to them saying that in case of an emergency, you are to call an 0208 landline number to speak to a cctv person. i mean, come on. it’s a joke. the gym has declined rapidly over the last year from the start of some good pts leaving (which i don’t blame them to be honest) to the lights flashing constantly in the free weights area to a section of the gym not having lights on because they clearly don’t work to the air con being absolutely rubbish and hardly ever on. to say i’m not impressed is an understatement.  it has now become a joke and just laughing at it all every time i get to the gym to see what else isn’t working. there used to be 9kg, 12kg and 15kg med balls but they’re not around anymore. nothing gets replaced! there used to be way more boxes but now i think there’s only 1 of 2.  since i’ve been a member at this gym, there have always been creepy members there too. just odd people that stare at you whilst you lift and so obviously too. i was absolutely astounded to find out a while ago that after having to physically avoid one specific member in the gym because he was dodgy, strange and overall off putting as he would always come over to me to make conversation and tell me that i’m not working hard enough (firstly get lost and do one - who are you to judge how someone else is training) and secondly a few months ago, i walked into the gym to find he was actually a pt now in puregym bcc. wow. puregym you’ve stooped low with this one. creepy members is one thing but employing someone who was one of these people is a new low.  to hear about the stuff that’s been going on in the gym with some pts (apparently i am not allowed to name them), to tell you the truth i am not surprised at all. what i am surprised about is how another pt (apparently i am not allowed to name this person either) also isn’t one of these pts to be caught.  honestly though, once ry, aron and jimmy leave, puregym bcc is going to really go downhill - these are the only good pts left - if it’s not already doing so. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️"
5,2023-07-12,Good gym great location,"good gym great location cannock plenty of equipment nice and clean , like the fact you scan in and out to access the door so feel safe. plenty of parking which is a bonus and i can pop into the shops around it will keep on going indefinitely"
5,2023-07-27,Take negative reviews with a pinch of salt!!,"just joined the gym after a very long hiatus...i will say i was a bit dubious after some scathing reviews, but i like to make my own decision..and i went for my first visit today about 4ish.. entry process so straight forward and no need to faff around with membership cards. plenty of space, plenty of equipment cardio and weights etc.. overall a really positive experience and an absolute bargain in my opinion! there is a cleaning station and anti bac everywhere.. yes its not state of the art equipment, but if you want that then go pay £60-£100 a month !! i think its great value of money and i am so glad i joined and the endorphins well and truly gained 🙌💪"

4,2023-07-26,Welcoming environment,"i was quite nervous to go gym. so i decided to get a pt to build my confidence up and to have someone to lead me as i wasn’t confident enough to go by myself and in what workouts to do. so i do say to those who are new to the gym and not so confident to definitely get a pt. i do recommend alex who is mine, he was very welcoming from day one and has pushed me to always try my best and to never quit. i do look forward to my sessions with alex, as i feel so accomplished and proud of myself afterwards because i know i’ve pushed myself to do my absolute best. after a few sessions with alex i was confident enough to venture to the gym by myself, i’ve tried a class called combat which was lead by emma and i can’t wait to try more classes as i really enjoyed it. from what i’ve experienced so far, it’s a welcoming environment and everyone is just focused on their own goals so you don’t feel judged or anything like that."
1,2023-07-27,The gym is a furnace in summer,the gym is a furnace in summer. you can barely exercise for more than 10 mins before you get too hot to continue. someone even feinted the other day due to the heat. staff never respond to requests to lower the temperature. overall a really unpleasant experience.
5,2023-07-04,Great experience,"great experience, a lot of equipment that will suit all types of training that you may want to do. relaxing atmosphere which i was happy with as i can get rather anxious, also, there are separate shower cubicles which i prefer as i am more comfortable with that.  all in all a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere with great, friendly staff that helps to guide you and give you assistance in how to use equipment if you are unsure. oh and there are vending machines with drinks, protein bars etc if you want to buy  them as well as free water to fill your bottle with to drink."
3,2023-07-27,Hygiene,"i really enjoy being a member of pure gym  marsh mills plymouth, great staff, great equipment but with one serious  disappointing concern.. the showers are generally really dirty, the water temperature is lukewarm, this can have a negative impact on muscle recovery and cause cramping. most importantly at this low temperature the spread of bacteria and fungal infections is increased. it’s unhygienic and a real concern that pure gym need to address.. apparently an energy crisis is the reason,, profit over hygiene and customer health is a concerning factor.."
2,2023-07-23,Massively gone down hill!,"came in over the weekend and the gym floor was an absolute mess, bottles and rubbish left lying round everywhere! it’s never staffed over the weekends any more! all the female toilets were not working! since changing management, this place has gone massively downhill! one of the few good things it has going for it is their pt chris! always has a smile on his face, always happy to see members and help! he’s a credit to that gym!"

4,2023-06-12,Turn the air con on and sort your class booking system,it would be a 5 as this new gym is great apart from the air con being non existent and the difficulty in booking classes. if you go into the app to book a class it puts you on a waiting list and sometimes you don’t see you have been accepted for the class until the night before or that day. it’s not a great process and if you don’t keep checking you could miss that you’ve been accepted into the class and that’s a strike against you. please revert to what other pure gyms do… release so many places for each class so you know if you are in or out

4,2023-07-25,Friendly clean gym,"this gym is clean, open 24/7 and has a huge open area, from the other side equipment is limited not enough for abs workout or limited availability of leg workout equipment. sometimes on afternoon the gym is overcrowded. overall i do like it and has a friendly environment (staff members are very healpfull)."

3,2023-07-24,Been a long time member,"been a long time member, gym instructors are great, really friendly and helpful - the classes are excellent but my main gripe is the spin bikes are no longer repaired in the same frequency as previously, every week it’s a scramble to get a bike that works, same bikes have been broken for months - it’s really a problem and needs addressing, instructors mic doesn’t work and even the clock in spin room has been stopped for months . main gym is great, clean enough and equipment downstairs is maintained. just needs regular attention to the spin suite and quickly"

5,2023-07-22,Brilliant experience,brilliant experience. the water in the showers felt cold. at least luke warm not cold i know you are trying to save upon bills
1,2023-07-24,CONGESTED AND NO CONCERN FOR SAFETY!,"congested and no concern for safety! in reference to the london collindale location.  not even worth it for a budget gym. pay the little bit more and choose somewhere more decent. the ceiling is always leaking with the slightest bit of rain and they never seem to be concerned or fix it, instead they just place numerous buckets around in the already congested thoroughfare as the gym crams up with the unrestricted amount of members. the water that comes through is bad enough and a serious safety hazard without the bucket trip hazards and the actual smell of faeces that accompanies it. ive never seen it worse than on this occasion but there is so so often water dripping from ceiling. definitely a massive risk. and being 24 hours theyre just leaving themselves open to liability. do yourselves a favour and avoid at all costs.  edit: their generic response to this review only adds insult to injury and shows their complete lack of care when it comes to customer service."

Needs improvement,"i have been a member at tunbridge wells for 3 years but as other users say, it has gone downhill in last six months. since they took away the  cleaning stations, it is now filthy- dusty, sweaty, smelly. tvs don’t work, cardio machines often out of order, air conditioner patchy. i complained  when they first removed the cleaning stations (may 2023), and they responded to say it was an experiment and they had an enhanced cleaning programme. i complained again this week because it was so dirty that i actually left mid session- sticky handles on elliptical and rowing machines, chewing gum stuck on running machine. i was just sent the same response - word for word - that i had in may. such poor customer service. i’m going to give it one more go next week. if it’s not better, i’m gone and will cancel my daughter’s membership too."
3,2023-07-23,"Not like it used to be, too many cutbacks","air con has been turned down a lot so very stuffy inside. in fact, the same old chestnut, lack of money but surely the client should get what they are paying for as puregym charges have gone up but quality gone down a lot. terrible lack of staff so no one to turn to when needed, why?  on the plus side, good to see the return of paper towels and spray even though not enough clients seem to use them, shame as it is disgusting to see machines covered in sweat. it is not worth cutting back on hygiene as it is very important.  as there is no physical member of staff to check you in, it gets noticed that there are a number of very young lads who enter and no staff to check their age etc, in this day and age i would have thought health & safety is an issue here as an accident could happen and then what?"

4,2023-07-23,Could Do Better With Repairs.,"plenty of equipment / machines to use all at a reasonable monthly cost. nice air conditioning that works and keeps you comfortable during a workout. vast improvemnet with the environment and cleanliness recently. repairs taken place which makes the place look better as it was looking a bit tired. one thing that bugs me though, the cold tap in the mens locker room has not worked properly for months. push button down to turn on, but its broken and does not automatically turn off as it should do, you have to lift it up yourself to shut the water flow off. this may sound trivial, but i dread to think how many hundreds of litres of water has been wasted over the months. the really sad thing is that i know its been reported to more than one member of staff and yet..... still not repaired!"

1,2023-07-04,80 people in the gym and it's like a sauna!!!,80 people in the gym and its like a sauna. checked every air conditioning unit and not 1 was blowing out cold air on the ground floor. its july for god sake. makes training very uncomfortable. leg press machine was faulty and looked dangerous to use but had not been closed off. accident waiting to happen. weights everywhere as usual. male changing room dirty and stinks. bins on gym floor overflowing. no staff around to tell about the issues. its sunday at 3pm not the middle of the night surely someone should be there. been a member at pure for a long time but can see standards slipping daily. the air con is never on anymore and the showers now are barley warm. seems they are trying to save money. poor poor service.
2,2023-07-21,So much promise with such little delivery.,"the kit here is not bad at all, albeit skewed towards weights rather than cardio. in busy periods the (lack of) cardio kit can prove an achilles heel and having to wait for it can be frustrating. a little more thought towards the layout could actually fit more cross trainers / bikes in so this is something that would improve the place. free weights area is good. plenty of selection and kit. people are mostly tidy and put their kit back back, but as per other gyms this isn’t always the case. there are however some fairly big issues, hence the two stars. all of which could be easily resolved but the on site staff/ puregym as a company seem reluctant to do.  * male changing rooms. these are consistently dirty, even after the cleaners have just cleaned (if you ever witness the cleaners doing their job you’ll see why - very poor). the showers are also a bone of contention, and with only three to begin with the fact that they are now down to one shower for an entire male changing room in a busy gym is unacceptable. one of the out of order showers has had a broken door for 7 weeks, again unacceptable. inside of the lockers is consistently dirty too and many lockers have the locks left on all week, again not enforced by the staff.  * the rules are not enforced. there are multiple printed out sheets telling you of them , (they love a laminated document and some blu tac here), but little enforcement. groups of young males training vocally, not putting their kit back and half clothed doesn’t create an inviting environment for all, as puregym say they do, and these rules are not enforced. multiple laminated sheets printed out telling people they will be banned for training semi- clothed and not putting their kit back = nothing actually happens.  *maintenance times. when kit breaks here it takes weeks/ months to fix. appreciate it’s a big company and bangor is out in the sticks so to speak, but this is still pretty shoddy. leg extender machine has had a nice laminated notice on it to not push beyond point 8 for 2 months, but not actually been fixed, shower door as above, cross trainer took 6 weeks + to fix…. when something breaks here there appears to be no sense of urgency from the on site staff particularly or puregym as a company. the urinal in the male changing room was full of urine for a month not long ago before it was fixed.  * water. the water as a whole here is an issue and they 100% have an on site issue , i’m a plumber and know what i’m looking for. the water fountain pressure is up and down and barely a dribble, shower pressure ,( when they work), is also barely a dribble and the male urinals flush 24/7, they never stop. this has nothing to do with saving water with regards to the low pressure, this is an on site issue. again going on for months, again not sorted.  the air con. the pace is stuffy and need good, reliable air circulation. it doesn’t have that, and as a consequence the place is warmer than a gym should be, and the plethora of gym members here who don’t smell every nice make the warm, sticky environment that little bit worse. the place has a smell to it which isn’t pleasant a lot of the time.   puregym really need to get their act together here, or all they’ll end up with having as members are the students who want a cheap gym membership, and mostly these are the same students who don’t put their weights back/throw their litter away/train half clothed - think on that one for a second.  they also need to employ a management team on site who is more proactive and gets stuff done. the gym and site has gone massively down hill over the last three months and continues to go more down the more time goes on, which will only get worse. the management team in place at the beginning of the year was more prone to challenging members and keeping on top of kit repairs, rather than laminating a sheet saying they’re doing it and then not actually getting it done. no offence to the current team as they’re lovely people, but they’re meek and reserved and don’t follow up on their promises to get issues sorted. ‘we’ve reported it’ and ‘we’re waiting for an engineer’ only holds so much water. report more, chase more, until it’s done. that’s customer service, that’s customer satisfaction and that is what this site is missing, which is a shame. the lack of experience from management here can be summarised by an instagram posts from the manager a few weeks ago. it was 20 odd degrees outside, so warm, and their water went off. no toilets/water fountain/showers or taps. but the manager put an instagram post up saying people can still come to the gym. you just can’t drink, pee or shower. the mind boggles.  a more customer focussed, business savvy manager, better enforcement of the rules and and more urgency regarding the repairs and that would sort this place, but at the moment it’s a mess.  que the pg copy and paste reply :)"

4,2023-07-23,Great use of space end good kit,"pure gym crystal peaks.  great use of space end extremely clean. brilliant number of racks for squats/deadlifts/bench. free weights area tidy and plenty of benches too.  could do with a bit more leg machines such as leg extensions. air con could be a bit cooler too.  otherwise great looking gym, good equipment and good value."

4,2023-07-21,Clean and new,"the 24/7 access is great. the gym is brand new and (mostly) clean.  i have attended a couple of classes, but mainly use the workouts on the app (which tells you how busy the gym is at that moment) or do my own thing. i would love there to be more variety of classes available (aerobics, zumba, pilates, step) and at different times, especially over the weekend. if there were more evening/late classes i might be able to attend more.  i would happily pay an extra £1 a month for chilled water - the tap water fountains dispense water which is lukewarm, and i don’t want the flavoured yanga sports water or to buy a single-use plastic bottle from the vending machine.  the temperature of the gym can be a little warm, even pre-workout. i’d prefer it to be on the colder side than not cold enough - it’s an incentive to work harder to get warm!!  the showers are fixed at a cool temperature. i’m not one for boiling hot showers but it can feel like an ice bath after a good workout. i’m also fed up of having to clean other peoples’ hair out of the plug and off the walls of the shower. i always give everything a wipe down after i use it but others don’t seem as courteous.  there is only one cubicle in the changing room, meaning people have to queue to use it. there seem to be way more lockers than ever get used, so maybe some could be removed and another one or two cubicles put in.  i have a hidden disability but don’t feel comfortable using the accessible shower/toilet as it is very close to the nearby equipment so would have to push past people to use it. i’m not sure if a wheelchair user would be able to get in and out of the door, especially if someone was using nearby equipment."

4,2023-07-19,"Great equipment and staff, but….",can’t say a bad word about the equipment or staff. in peak times it’s so busy as it’s a small gym. there’s an empty building next to the gym its self. any plans on pure gym obtaining this ? would cut down on the waiting you have to do to get on equipment etc
5,2023-07-21,I love this gym and we are lucky to…,"i love this gym and we are lucky to have it in our doorstep. the staff are always friendly and approachable, the equipment up to date and in good condition amd theres always an upbeat atmosphere. my only complaint is that it was very warm, after only a short warm up i felt uncomfortable . i spoke to one of the trainers who agreed it was warm and had been for a while but it wasnt something they could sort in house. this would definitely make me think about going elsewhere as its important to feel comfortable when working out and room temperature is a big part of this."

2,2023-07-20,My experience with the gym's personal…,"my experience with the gyms personal trainer was nothing short of disappointing and uncomfortable. my friends(totally beginners) and i were in the middle of our workout, doing a superset, when the trainer approached us. he inquired about the number of sets remaining with the dumbbells. we informed him that we still had a considerable number of sets left to complete. he then suggested using heavier dumbbells, but unfortunately, there were no other suitable options available. he mockingly suggested that we should try using lighter weights upstairs. this condescending and belittling remark left us feeling humiliated and judged.  its disheartening to encounter such unprofessional behavior from a personal trainer who should be motivating and inspiring clients to push themselves, not ridiculing them for their chosen weights. making us feel inadequate and uncomfortable in the gym environment is completely unacceptable.  to make matters worse, he and his client continued to talk and stare at us, adding to the sense of being the center of unwanted attention. it was as if he was more interested in gossiping about us than actually focusing on his own clients workout.  this kind of behavior reflects poorly on the gym and its staff. as paying members, we should be treated with respect and encouragement, not subjected to mockery and discomfort. i sincerely hope the gym takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue promptly to ensure a more supportive and inclusive environment for all its members.  despite the unfortunate encounter with the rude gym staff, i must acknowledge that the gym itself offers a comprehensive range of equipment and facilities. however, it is imperative for the management to address and rectify such instances of unprofessional behavior to maintain a positive and inclusive environment for all members. i sincerely hope that my feedback will contribute to the improvement of overall customer satisfaction and service quality at the gym."
4,2023-06-02,I really like this gym,"i really like this gym. ive used and had memberships in gyms all over the city and as far as equipment and staff friendliness goes, its superb !! the only thing(s) that saved me from giving a 5 star review is that they took away the vibrating plate which i used every time i visited . i was told it was taken away as it was barely used , so unless it was just coincidence that people only used it while i was there (definitely not the case) then it must  be a budget issue. if there were a couple of punchbags & a speedball there i would definitely be in there everyday but there are none of these items available so i have to use another gym for that kind of training but overall it is a very good place to workout.  the only complaint i do have is really nothing to do with the gym or the staff but it is when you have a workout planned and you need to use certain equipment or machines but the machine you need to use next is being ""used"" by someone that spends more time sitting on the machine using their phone than actually using the machine. if phones were banned from the gym floor then people would manage to complete their workout routine and get through it a lot quicker. instead i just need to give it a miss or do something else as someone really needs to look through facebook sitting on the pec-fly machine"

1,2023-07-20,Extremely non-hygienic,"extremely non-hygienic bathrooms & changing rooms, clogged drains in showers & sinks with the most horrible smell you can imagine that lingers for weeks with stains & rubbish everywhere on the floor. out of service signs sit on various broken equipment for months. definitely bring your own cleaning liquid and tissue as gym doesnt provide, as someone else pointed out, you see other people sweat sticking on the benches. you need to increase the frequency of ""deep"" cleaning, otherwise the amount of cleaning at the moment is borderline negligent."
3,2023-07-05,The equipment and space is good but the temperature management / A/C operation is historically poor,"as a long term local, i have been a user well before they bought the gym from la fitness 10 years ago and can say that the equipment and space is very good but the temperature management (especially cooling in the summer months) in this mostly windowless gym, is historically poor, either some of the a/cs are turned off purposely (perhaps to save costs) and/or continue to be purely maintained to save costs and remain off, which, combined with the lack of windows / fresh air makes exercising difficult and boarderline unhealthy  also, mantenance in the wcs is poor, the mens middle cubicle toilet floor has been mostly damaged and somewhat dangerous to trip over for more than 24 months, while a couple of cubicle door locks missing for weeks although i suspect these practices to apply across all puregyms, puregym head office need to review this gym immediately  moreover the site management, especially the assistant managers attitude is unacceptable, not only appear not to have been trained to listen to member customers when they try to question or suggest improvements but have a bit of an attitude as well, possibly due to lack of experience and/or training talking to customers. puregym will need to review its site staff and consider some customer service training asap  it seems that similar with many companies that have grown fairly fast very soon, the puregym headoffice / board is more interested in collecting membership fees and not looking after maintenance and well being of its thousands of member customers, which is a shame really for such a successful business model to have such a central and avoidable maintenance and customer service flaws"

4,2023-07-19,The gym has a variety of equipment,"the gym has a variety of equipment, hardly ever short of a machine even when it’s full and lots of classes available throughout the day. the instructors i’ve trained with are friendly and helpful giving training tips.  lots of weights to choose from and the gym is kept tidy.  love that there are sunday classes!  it’s shame that there are so many tv’s in the gym but non of them are on. i don’t use head phones, i like the gym atmosphere and motivational music, dance videos or even the distraction of a screen with a programme to watch while working out.  the new water dispenser is good and i like the flavors that it has but often it doesn’t work and most of the time the vending machines don’t work either, would be worth having them serviced."

3,2023-07-19,Usually pretty good but......,not sure whats going on on wednesday evenings at the minute - went in on wednesday 12th and the music in the studio area was so loud i left a couple of minutes with my ears ringing.  wednesday 19th i was in again - music was loud but okay. after 15 minutes the volume went up and i left.  i expect music in the gym but i dont expect ear damaging noise levels

5,2023-07-19,My Gym,good place to exercise.
5,2023-07-19,A brilliant gym,a great gym for anytime of the day.
1,2023-07-18,Entry app crashes continuously,"to use many features which are part of the gym, including entry you need to use the app. unfortunately, it is a dreadful app which fails continuously. i have waited for 5 minutes before trying to get the app to load to allow me to get into the gym. yesterday at the lewisham branch i could not get the app to load, and so i went through an open door to ask the staff that i could see to help me. they were incredibly rude and would not listen to what i was trying to tell them. their advice was to check my text messages for my pin number which i was apparently sent when i joined. as people change their phones on average every couple of years, this is not a practical solution. i am tired of paying for a service which does not work, and shocked at the service that i was given when i needed help. i will be cancelling my membership immediately and joining a competitor."
1,2023-07-19,this is not a nightclub,"this is not a nightclub, the music is too loud!!! cant pick up the phone or talk to anyone!!! pure services"
1,2023-07-19,Shocking Customer Service,"left to join the gym group who opened in my area, kept getting emails from pure offering me deals to go back, decent offer so tried to sign up, offer they emailed wasnt the price that was on payment screen tried charing more, contacted different departments via email and got told different things by each department, starting off with the deal was out of date the deal expire on the 07/07/23 but the email was sent on 12/07/23 so they emailed an out of dat offer. next issue was after emailed member services they said they email wasnt even from pure gym and it wasnt one of there email address, but then another person on member services said it was from them. tried to contact via facebook was then told that emails get sent out and they dont know the deals getting sent out. overall customer service is a joke and even time yoi try and get something sorted it gets back heeled and told you need to contact a different department. didnt bother rejoing stay with gym group."

1,2023-07-17,‘bench press damages the floor’,was told by the manager that you can’t do bench press by the squat racks because it damages the floor.  this place has a good set up for weightlifting and powerlifting - if only management allowed to use any of it..
4,2023-07-18,Very busy and well equipped,the staff member was friendly and motivated. i think the intro sessions should be done at a quieter time. it was extremely busy and noisy so found it difficult to hear and follow what was being taught. as an older lady that hasnt attended a gym in many years i felt i needed a more one to one introduction. it felt very daunting for me. i will try to go at a quieter time next time.
4,2023-07-16,Generally good,generally a good gym with plenty of equipment and helpful staff. my only issue is the sanitising stations are usually empty especially when unstaffed to the point where i take my own now.
1,2023-07-18,Made to feel awful,"went for an induction and being on the larger size it soon became apparent i was not a new member they wanted , i was made to feel small  talked at and not with i can only say this was one guy so i cant comment on the rest but definitely would not recommend for any larger person"
1,2023-07-18,The gym is closed from 16th of July,"the gym is closed from 16th of july. thisnis the second time on this month. what i dont understand, the gym is new, has 6 months from when has been open. im paying monthly for a membership where i should have access 24/7. and almost every motht the gym is not accessible. the hygiene is very bad, toilets 🚻 are very dirty. same as the machines, very dusty, sweaty, u cant even clean yourself,  u dont have any wipes or anything to be clean. the attitude if the managers and staff is awful. they dont have respect and costumers service skills at all. they are very rude and disrespectful. when i  try to aproche them with a issue in the gym, or asking them something, the answer i got ""thats not my f**** problem,  what you want me to do?!very very rude. im very disappointed of the service received by this puregym on stratford center."
1,2023-07-16,Puregym Stratford,"there was no option for 0 starts. where can i start first?! i sign up on saturday at the puregym stratford , and sunday when i got at the gym the gym was closed until further notice, nobody informed us regarding this matter, there is no customer phone number only facebook messenger and email address, of course you can’t complain to anyone. secondly that red hair manager lady , oh man… you need some school love! she doesn’t even know how to talk to customers basic questions about the gym, on top very rude unprofessional, no polite nothing , why she is even there ?she can’t run that gym all the customers will leave, as a manager you need skills for customer service is vital . do some trainings please .this gym was opened in january and is already closed disappointing honestly, the first think when i checked this gym , wasn’t feel welcomed, was very hot inside there is air con problems, smelly , dirty and broken equipment, i regret i signed in ,will try different brunch if not happy will have to just cancel it. evoid !"
1,2023-07-10,The new layout is awful,the new layout is awful before i could enjoy my cv workout in one area now i have to switch between floors. this wouldnt be so bad but you now get gangs of lads hanging out around the machines; whereas this wasnt an issue before as they were mostly downstairs but now its like running a gauntlet moving between machines. plus you have to put up with the awful music the spin classes play - can we have at least a few of the treadmills back upstairs?
5,2023-07-18,Brilliant gym,"i hadn’t been in a gym for a number of years, had babies and life etc so confidence was really low, i joined in december. i was made to feel welcome, the introduction session was great and explained everything. the staff are amazing and if you have a problem or question you can speak to them, they are great. i love the classes, especially sam’s thursday morning and andrea’s wednesday morning classes, they will kill you off (in a good way). the equipment is fab, loads available and plenty of variety. honestly love this gym, it’s become part of my routine and coming here has given me my confidence back, i feel strong and healthy. definitely recommend!"
4,2023-07-04,"Good gym with good equipment, annoying PTs","good gym with good equipment, dont like the pts. ive had 2 come up to me to ask if i want to become a pt there when im halfway through sets and then have a long conversation with me when im clearly not interested. im also not a fan of recieving emails and ads on my phone (and pop ups in the app) asking me to try classes- im at the gym to do my own thing, im already giving you a monthly payment so stop asking me to subscribe to more services or try things out; i know what im doing. one of the pts at my local is also quite rude but thats not on you guys, hes just a small guy."

1,2023-07-17,A waste of money .. not even worth the cheap price,"i first joined puregym longbridge back in 2021 when covid was still around, the gym was always clean, not too busy and staff were always around, very helpful whenever you need them unfortunately the gym went downhill when covid restrictions lifted, the staff are much less engaged, the gym is busy most of the time, and it’s not that clean anymore! i cancelled my membership after few bad experiences (not being able to get the equipment i wanted or waiting around for it to be free, and not finding much space to do anything in the functional area) i have recently paid for a day pass to try their yoga class  just to go and find out that the staff didn’t even know there was a yoga class happening or who the instructor was, after waiting for around 10 minutes we were told that the instructor is not coming! which was just ridiculous! i’ve never experienced something like this in any gym before!!  i knew that cancelling my membership was the right decision, i would rather pay for something that i get something good out of it, but puregym is just a waste of both time and money"

2,2023-07-15,Deliberate slamming down of equipment and weights,"spacious and 24/7 access is good. however, way too many selfish people attend this gym, deliberately and aggressively slamming down/dropping the equipment and weights rather than lowering them, thus making it a very stressful environment for people suffering from mental health/ptsd/noise sensitivity (even with noise cancelling headphones). i’ve been complaining to the management team for nearly a year but nothing has ever been done. my latest email to the manager (5/6 weeks ago) hasn’t even had a reply. very unprofessional!  in addition, the wifi isn’t available in certain areas of the gym. the manager told me 3/4 months ago a wifi changeover was taking place, hence the poor signal, yet it still hasn’t been sorted out."

5,2023-07-14,Ladies Only Area in Park Royal…,"i have been a member of my local pure gym for a while now (on and off) and i never seemed to enjoy it (for a myriad of reasons). so, i found myself going less and less.  one day, i was looking up a ladies only gym and discovered that pure gym park royal has one. so, i took it upon myself to go and check it out and omg i absolutely loved it! the decor was gorgeous, there were plenty of equipment and not many ladies plus it’s so spacious! it made me so happy! i’m defintely going there more. thank you pure gym for giving us a ladies only area! :)"
4,2023-07-15,New lighting,ive been pretty happy with my experience at the gym in general except the lighting . it went from flickering for months in one area to them changing the lighting completely that now literally blinds me when im lying on a bench. the lighting is great for a spinning class but not when you are benching.

3,2023-07-14,Need to police people on mobile phones while on machines,"its a great gym,got everything you need from free weights to an abundance of machines,but theres a massive issue with mobile phones,by that i mean people that are actually there to train struggle to get on machines as people are spending sometimes 30 minutes at a time on them and most of that is spent texting or on social media,if it wasnt for this issue my rating would have been 5"

2,2023-07-08,Intentionally poor hygiene facilities,"picked up ringworm as a result of their policy to remove all self-cleaning stations. its a nice gym, but poor air conditioning and lack of convenient cleaning facilities means lots of sweating and really high risk of catching athletes foot and ringworm etc. im itchy all over. im usually very hygienic so this has annoyed me.  according to another review, this was done intentionally:  ""we developed industry-leading cleaning and hygiene protocols to help keep our members and employees safe during the covid-19 pandemic, however, with the reduced risk and in line with the government’s ending of legal restrictions, we have decided to remove self-cleaning stations in our gyms, which will also support our sustainability objectives by reducing our paper towel waste."""

1,2023-07-09,Literally not fit for use,"joined in spring, really enjoyed starting my fitness journey with you guys. felt like i was making progress.  unfortunately, i am now looking elsewhere as current equipment does not have fans on and the air-conditioning is, as the staff who i complain to keep telling me, ""set to a smart metre for our carbon footprint"". its simply too hot to workout before 8pm. which is ok for some people, obviously, but does not fit to my schedule.  i am all for looking after the environment, but perhaps you could look at running less vending machines or something to cut power usage? cool air in the summer is pretty essential in a gym."
4,2023-07-03,I had a good experience and enjoyed…,"i had a good experience and enjoyed attending the gym; the staff are friendly and ready to help. i think it would be good if the team standing at the gym entrance should try to greet and welcome customers with a smile when they are coming into the gym. it will make a day for some customers. secondly, i use a vibration plate as part of my routine exercise, and it has stopped working for over three months now; nothing has been done to it."

3,2023-07-04,Gym review,"overall these days i attend on non-peak times, so i manage to train without problems. the tissue to clean equipment has disappeared downstairs and upstairs so, if somebody has dropped liquids on a bench or left the cardio machine wet there is no possibility to clean leaving no other choice but to not use the equipment. the toilets are still a grey area.  you let motorbikes park on the bicycle stalls and sometimes it is difficult to find space. the motorbikes do not need to stay in those spaces and there is no need for them to stay there. i am aware those stalls are yours. one has been literally cut with a saw. are you going to replace it?"

1,2023-07-06,New layout is crap!!,"what is going on with the new layout of the place??? all the extra bodies now downstairs and the cross trainers blocking the entrance has got to be an increased health and safety risk!! should a fire break out there will be a stampede of people all clambering to get out!! health and safety issues aside as a female who visits your gym doing mostly cardio i was able to do all my workout upstairs where it had everything i needed, now for some reason all the treadmills have been moved downstairs!! i feel uncomfortable and awkward having to use these machines downstairs where it is predominantly males. as you offer no female only classes i feel the least you could do is to move things back the way they were instead of trying to force males and females to mix when some just don’t want too!!"

1,2023-07-11,. . . .,"the one star review here isn’t a reflection on the gym in any way at all, it’s just to draw attention to behaviour that seems to be ignored.  myself and a friend have had negative experiences with the men mentioned in the previous reviews.  i understand that there are some positive reviews, but just because these men have been nice to you and treated you in an appropriate manner doesn’t mean that they haven’t treated other people inappropriately."

3,2023-07-07,School kids and fraud tarnish a good gym,"good gym however i don’t get how school children can use the gym.  if you’re in between 3pm-4pm, school teens in their uniforms walk in, get changed and are in their groups around the machines. i thought there was an age restriction for h&s?  also in the evening, there are lots of people doubling up in the pods to get in/out which makes a mockery of paying gym users.  please investigate and sort please to make the gym a much bette place to train"
3,2023-07-07,Air con seriously needs sorting,the class i did on my most recent visit was amazing but the lack of air con really doesnt help. i had to stop my workout because i could feel myself getting overheated. in previous gyms ive been able to push myself further because i wasnt getting too hot. its not just this branch either. buckingham has no temperature control which is very irritating when you pay a premium to use both.

1,2023-07-09,This gym made me cancel my subscription,"cancelled because of the staff. first you should never touch anyone without their permission. then to interupt them mid-set is also dangerous. then to stop your own training session to interupt someone else is just going out if your way to put someone down. been to all the puregyms in belfast and this is the worst. equipment is mostly in the wrong place or not there. cleaning facilities are poor. that can be excused for the price but then to get told off by the staff was enough to make me cancel my membership to all gyms. he went out of his way to interupt me mid- set. while he was training someone else. to tell me i was using the equipment wrong. i think its intimidating enough to start a gym. dealing with staff like this makes it impossible.  editing this for anyone interested. raised my complaint to the email below. they replied basically to say there was nothing they could do. and if i felt that strongly about it, call the police...... shocking."

2,2023-07-09,The gym it self is good but mostly on…,the gym it self is good but mostly on single machines. twice in a day i couldn’t use the back row and bicep bar because these two lads was using them 30min plus and when asked they looked agitated. most of the time people are sitting with their phones on a machine. some people are nice it’s just them bad apples that ruin our experience. i’ve signed up to another gym unfortunately as it’s pointless to go gym if i can’t use it.
5,2023-07-10,Totally enjoyable.,totally enjoyable. ty
1,2023-06-23,There was a used sanitary pad with…,there was a used sanitary pad with bloody stuck to the mirror in the women’s changing rooms.  apparently this has happened on a number of occasions and it’s faeces and used sanitary products.  what is being done to stop this? i am paying a monthly fee and don’t expect to see this in the toilet.
4,2023-07-05,The only reason for not giving 5 stars…,the only reason for not giving 5 stars is the lack of mats and condition of them - there don’t seem to be enough outside of the cage area and the ones that are available are quite worn in places.
5,2023-07-10,Great equipment very clean with a…,great equipment very clean with a friendly bunch of staff
5,2023-07-08,Day Pass Ideal,"easy to book in a day pass with the app, at off-peak times these gyms are great."
2,2023-07-04,Cleanliness is very poor,"cleanliness is very poor.  dust everywhere which triggers my ashtma!  many members walking around in sliders,  seems more of a social gathering for people rather than exercise"
5,2023-07-10,I love Puregym,i love puregym. i go to shiprow which is easy access as i live centrally. i love going early in the morning as it sets me up for the day. the gym has a variety of machines and it is spacious. i couldn’t imagine my life without the gym 💜🤩💜

5,2023-07-04,An amazing Gym with helpful staff,an amazing gym with helpful staff. the classes are fantastic! pleased to be a member
3,2023-07-03,Classes format not for me,"i like the gym, its clean, good atmosphere and they have all the machines you need. the half an hour classes in a circuit style, repeating the same 3/4 exercises not for me. i dont enjoy the class with that format and you are killing the same muscles for half an hour. even though its a budget gym i think the monitors could prepare half an hour class better."
3,2023-07-05,Broken cold showers,broken cold showers. only 1of the 4 remaining is warm enough to shower drains smell like hell never bothers to clean behind the baskets on the shower wall
5,2023-07-05,The new Knaresborough Gym is just…,the new knaresborough gym is just awesome... just love it...
3,2023-07-05,Male PTs walking into ladies area,love that there is a ladies area. hate that male pts will continually walk in which defeats the purpose and has prevented me from coming in on many an occasion. will probably discontinue membership if this continues
3,2023-07-04,The Wifi is still not working,"the wifi is still not working, it would be good if the o2 wifi got fixed"

5,2023-07-08,A friendly gym,"i love pure gym because of its membership price, location to where i live and the friendly, inclusive atmosphere."
5,2023-07-09,Odie,"i have been attending this gym for around 6 months and i love it! i usually attend odie’s morning classes and they are my favourite and it is the main reason i continue coming to this puregym. my friend and i find odie really attentive, he listens to feedback and we love the vibes he brings to the classes with his enthusiasm and good music taste! he is always smiling and a  familiar friendly face in the gym. when i am running late in the mornings he always offers to pack away my equipment so i can make the most of the class. overall i am really happy with my experience."
5,2023-07-04,Lovely staff,i have done a few classes and the staff are very friendly.

5,2023-07-05,Local gym so more likely to continue…,local gym so more likely to continue coming. never too busy. clean. cool environment.  plenty of classes. loving it. mental health improved and generally feeling better and healthier 👍
1,2023-07-07,Appalling Conditions,"staff all seem decent and friendly enough however some people who attend this gym spoil it for others, over the past few months the showers have included puddles of urine, cigarette waste and faeces, and with the removal recently of the cleaning stations it makes the gym hygenically unsafe to attend. also avoid paying extra for the zenga water machine as flavours are regularly empty."
5,2023-07-10,Great place for a workout,"great place for a workout. easy access to car park, clean facility. the staff are friendly and helpful"
4,2023-07-05,Overall good value for money,wasn’t busy and a good selection of equipment.  i would prefer an extra squat rack and one of the showers still hasn’t had privacy glass installed
4,2023-07-05,Great,"loads of equipment, feels inviting, very clean and a great place to be, but gets very busy at peak times. staff are friendly and helpful, fantastic that its open 24 hours. tho the ac could do with being on a little more, especially with the humid weather weve been having. great location and 3 hours free parking. overall, its really good, and i love going."
5,2023-07-09,Its great to see a whole new team and…,its great to see a whole new team and some amazing new ideas brought to the gym in ashton. look so much spacious now and tidy. im well motivated when i walked in :-)
3,2023-07-05,Marsh Mills Plympton - generic gym,"joined marsh mills plympton. it’s busy as many other puregyms are, and this to be expected. the app helps plan times that suit. only real beef is there is no internet connection in the building and the ‘free wifi’ is a useful as a chocolate teacup - it has no internet connection!! why have something that is useless and fails expectations? if you want to listen to music or your favourite podcast while training, then download first.  *reply to puregym - i did raise it with the gym manager. they agree the wifi is not fit for purpose, but no plans to address it."
4,2023-07-05,Great gyms in most locations,"great gyms in most locations. sometimes difficult if there’s no parking. classes amazing and run well. i have had two occasions where i’ve cancelled a class and then i’m emailed that i’ve missed it, it’s a little annoying. sometimes classes are overbooked for the space it has and people join without booking."
4,2023-07-05,Enjoyable classes,enjoyable classes. great insight from staff
4,2023-07-07,Facilitates and environment OK,"facilitates, environment and staff generally good.  inexpensive. comprehensible opening hours."

3,2023-07-05,Inadequate first aid kit,"i tripped outside the gym recently and badly cut my knee and also cut my hand prior to attending a class at the gym.  i found a fitness instructor inside the gym and asked for some plasters from a first aid kit.  unfortunately the first aid kit didnt contain any.  instead i received 2 antiseptic wipes which, while useful did nothing to stem the blood.  i struggled in my class with a very bleeding knee and hands. i think this wasnt good enough at all and better first aid measures ought to be in place. shocked."
1,2023-07-05,No cleaning station for an extremely…,no cleaning station for an extremely overcrowded and sweaty gym. air con only comes on a certain time of the day
1,2023-07-05,Worst puregym,"every time i visit this gym the free weights sections is always an absolute bomb site, i make an effort to put my weight back in the proper place but there’s weights everywhere and all mixed up also, they only have cable machine, there should be at least two or three and less treadmills."
5,2023-07-04,I really like PureGym as a no frills…,"i really like puregym as a no frills gym. very user friendly, flexible contracts and easy to use. nice gyms, kitted out well and in good locations with parking. overall a win win situation."
1,2023-07-05,The staff needs to be in all the time l…,the staff needs to be in all the time l don’t know how to use some machine l can’t ask anyone also our friend has injured today we could not find any start for medical first aid staff in
2,2023-07-09,General Concerns,i have been going to this gym for over 2 years now the decline in staff and attention to detail as opposed to other puregym’s is quite alarming the weights are constantly scattered and hoarded by both users and personal trainers alike there is no enforcement of hygiene where other puregyms enforce putting back weights into the appropriate section. there is also a lack of equipment where i find myself looking for one attachment for quite a while before it is available to me. find that over the last few weeks this has gotten progressively worse and whilst the price is good it should not reflect the poor standards set in this gym
1,2023-07-05,The sport drink machine still out of…,the sport drink machine still out of flavours - been like it all week. i pay for this in my membership! the gym is filthy - weights everywhere
1,2023-07-05,The gym was untidy and felt unhygienic,"the gym was untidy and felt unhygienic. but the true reason i don’t care to return is the client base. it’s full of poor mannered youths with an appalling attitude. no matter the hour i attend, it’s horrifically over crowded. when the month runs out, it’ll be the last time i visit a pure gym."
3,2023-07-05,Staff is good but when people don’t put…,staff is good but when people don’t put their weights back they should be told. also one leg extension machine is just not enough
3,2023-07-05,Busted treadmills Aintree,the front door is still broken and at least 4 treadmills not working yesterday and today.
1,2023-07-04,It's very difficult to get in contact…,"its very difficult to get in contact with pure gym. it happened to me twice that i was sent an email that i didnt cancel my classes on time. however, i did cancel them on time, once even one day before. in both cases, i tried to contact pure gym and explain, however no-one got back to me."
1,2023-07-05,Cancelling of classes,arrived for a class this morning and no one showed up to take it. classes are cancelled at short notice and not always notified by email. if we miss a class we get a mark against our name but if no one shows up or a class is cancelled there is accountability by the gym
1,2023-07-05,Far too warm,far too warm  and stuffy

5,2023-07-09,Pure Gym Aintree,really good gym to train in and experienced trainers
2,2023-07-04,Would like to know why the cleaning…,would like to know why the cleaning spray and paper towels have been removed. so unable to clean equipment before i use. find this disgusting as touching other people’s sweat. makes me not want to go anymore.  this is harlow pure don’t know if others the same!!
2,2023-06-21,You couldn't pay me to train here,"extremely hot, extremely busy and extremely annoying.  i will preface this by saying that i only have positive experiences with the staff there. nothing against them. i would give the staff 5 stars. cameron, in particular, is an asset to the gym.  the place is like a cambodian jungle with the heat and humidity.  the brand new barbells and dumbbells have little to no knurling on them. quite dangerous, actually, when performing bench press and associated lifts in which a slip would be very bad news.  the gym gets so busy. not just a little busier at peak hours, it is unusable at peak hours. ~100 people in there officially. not to mention those unaccounted for, who enter the gym without a membership at the same time as their friends.  ive never been on a morning but on a weeknight, during the hours of 16:00-21:00, the gym is unusable. forget following an exercise routine. theres no chance.  equipment selection and utilisation of floor space is extremely poor. one flat bench press to serve the entire gym. not enough weight benches to serve the free weights section. flat bench and decline bench pushed right up against each other, preventing spotters from easily accessing them.  truthfully, they need a bigger facility, but more importantly than this is that they utilise the space that they do have effectively. the space upstairs is extremely poorly utilised. additionally, they should look to expand the entire upstairs and make it as large as the lower floor.  dont waste your time joining this gym. i have been attending gyms regularly for almost one decade now. never have i ever been so inconsistent with my routines. the gym does not permit it. i was a member for one month and have cancelled my membership. there have been many occasions where i turn up to the gym, only to walk straight out of the door.  puregym consett is a victim of its own success. it is supposed to be a budget gym, but with the cheapest membership at £22, the price certainly does not make up for the inconvenience. you couldnt pay me to use this gym."
2,2023-07-05,Place is getting worse,weights never put away. equipment that has been broke for weeks. and the water machine out if order.
2,2023-07-05,Gym in decline!,"i joined this gym approx 3 years ago, then it was clean and well maintained. recently, in the past 9 months it has got very messy and and quite dirty and the detergent for the equipment is always running out which means you cannot wipe the sweat off the equipment!! weights are left all over the place as well as empty drink bottles and cans!"
5,2023-07-08,I am one of the first people to sign…I am one of the first user of pure gym.,"i am one of the first people to sign before it opened after it opened. for me pure gym is very good, because it has everything i need. pure gym has done great, especially during the pandemic. but, i was  a bit disappointed when i saw sanitisers removed. i specifically discussed it with one of the staff, he tried to explain it to me that is not necessary any more. i strongly advise you at least to leave one on each floor."

3,2023-07-05,Way too hot - you’ve used air-con in past years in summer!,"great gym. not too busy nor too quiet. however, i have noticed in recent months how the unbearably hot it has become. in previous years the gym has not felt this hot so i suspect they are not turning the air-con on as often. this is making working out much more challenging as air is not being well ventilated. this issue needs to be raised as it is making workouts much more uncomfortable."
5,2023-07-04,Easy and straightforward.,"very easy gym to join and access.  no hassle.  the gym is clean and there are plenty of machines and equipment, so theres no waiting for someone to get off a piece of equipment.  staff i have passed have been friendly and nice."

3,2023-07-05,Place is going down hill,place is going down hill. went today loads of machines not working even the water station was out of order. no air conditioning on horrible smell in the building too.
4,2023-07-04,Brilliant management,the manager is always happy to help with your questions! he listens even if he can’t do anything about it. i wish the classes l like starts 6 pm though as l am always fighting against the traffic.
5,2023-07-05,Great gym,great gym! lots of equipment and always very clean.
5,2023-07-04,I love the varieties of equipment and…,i love the varieties of equipment and the atmosphere.
3,2023-07-04,Gyms are too busy and cramped,"gyms are too busy and cramped, they need to limit number of members they have. but then again for £22, can’t expect much.  joining another gym which is slightly more £38pm, which isn’t no where near as busy"
4,2023-07-09,Generally great but some issues,"classes are great and there are many exceptional instructors which keep me going back. however, there are two things that let it down.  1. the air temperature could be cooler. it can be extremely hot in there, before you have even begun to work out.  2. the spin bikes could do with better maintenance checks. i often find that one or all moving parts, such as the seat and handle bars are dysfunctional and will move during use despite being locked in.  if they could fix these issues then it would be 5/5."
4,2023-07-05,Good variety of weight and cardio…,"good variety of weight and cardio machines.just a pity not many of the screens are switched on,or are not working."
5,2023-07-03,I enjoy the gym again,"never really enjoyed going to the gym but going to pure has changed this.  it is a friendly environment, love the classes, they are challenging and supportive.  the gym is so clean, and it has lots of equipment and i never have to wait for a machine. added bonus is my gym membership is only £10.99 for the first year."
5,2023-07-04,Very good,the classes are reallu really good...instructors are very nice and professional
4,2023-07-09,Pure gym has some really good classes,"pure gym has some really good classes, each trainer works out in a different way. there are so many options to choose from in training, if you want to workout by yourself you can do it on your phone at the gym or at hom i have been at the gym for 2 months and i am very impressed."
5,2023-07-03,"Plenty of equipment,which.means even…","plenty of equipment,which.means even when busy there is always something to use. convenient position for town"
3,2023-07-04,Poor Session,weights strewn across the gym floor and a ridiculous racket from the class area. must’ve been harmful on the ear to anyone in the gym

5,2023-07-05,Great gym,"calvin, ciaran and the staff are very nice and welcoming. plenty of equipment and the gym is always clean."
1,2023-07-05,Absolutely rubbish,absolutely rubbish. dirty site which hasn’t had any new kit for years. quit as i was sick of everything being brown.
1,2023-07-05,Unclean & broken equipment,"half the time there is no soap in the male toilets, this is also the case with the hand sanitiser and sanitiser spray. i was told before that there was going to be another sanitising station added, that was months ago and still nothing. there are equipment that are broken for weeks, e.g. smith machine."
3,2023-07-05,Everything needed for a gym but no gym editicate,"everything needed for a gym, downfall, no gym educate when it comes to free weights, not many pts or staff about, more expensive than it should be for a non man gym."
3,2023-07-05,Got the basics only,got the basics only need more ventilation especially ladies room (stinky most of time and out of supplies) needs more cleaning and variety of machines.

4,2023-07-04,I like the gym overall,i like the gym overall. they could improve the bathrooms as the taps are hard to use and there no paper towels.
4,2023-07-04,Facilities and staff are very good.,"facilities and staff are very good. fees are very competitive and great value. some equipment could do with being replaced/upgraded quicker, especially those that are used excessively e.g. spin bikes. changing rooms and showers are generally kept clean although showers could do with more regular deep cleans."
3,2023-07-04,I don’t like the app at all and the fact all good trainers are leaving,"i don’t like the app at all, it gets weird, when i book the classes, i get the email that they’re booked and when i go to the app, i don’t see them booked. also, it doesn’t show after i cancel a class that is cancelled and that has led to me being banned from classes in the past when the problem is that it doesn’t update. please fix the app. also, i wish the trainers were treated better by puregym as they all end up leaving and nobody stays"
5,2023-07-05,Great gym,"great gym, clean. good air con friendly atmosphere staff pleasant and helpful"
5,2023-07-03,I  think is a really good gym to go…,i  think is a really good gym to go just need more attention for the new customer coming and joining the gym they need a little bit help.
3,2023-07-04,Cleaning stations reinstated,"now that youve reinserted the cleaning station im much happier.  having to use treadmills covered in visible sweat with no option to wipe down and clean the machine before use was seriously making me consider whether to change gyms.  youve recently put the prices up so the cost of the cleaning station and materials should have already been absorbed. taking them away for cost savings (which lets face it, it was clearly for) was frustrating particularly when youre always posting on your instagram how much you clean the gym.  thanks for listening to members and reinstating this.  the music is often too loud too, and gets cranked up on a weekend when the staff arrive. ive had to ask more than once for it to be turned down as i have my headphones on max and can still hear the music loudly above my own.  the spin classes are also too loud and ruin the ambience downstairs.  the gym is becoming a great gym since refurb and you do a lot to keep it cleaner and tidier, and the atmosphere is always very welcoming. please dont mess up the hard work over small things like a cleaning station and music levels."
4,2023-07-04,Great friendly staff/ personal…,great friendly staff/ personal trainers. professional and knowledgeable.
4,2023-07-04,Everything was Ok,everything was ok . i remind you the 10 and 5 kg weight is less than athlets need . i am going to pass personal trainer course and hope to join puregym group in the near future .
1,2023-07-09,CRAP CUSTOMER SERVICE. NO HELP,i joined puregym in february of this year when they advertised a new gym opening in falkirk. my membership fee and first months payment was taken. since then i have been trying to get information about when the gym will open. all i receive is automated replied telling me how to go on their website and join. i have already joined. all i want is to know when i will be able to use the gym. if this situation is an example of their customer service i dont think ill be with the m very long.
5,2023-07-04,Great place,"i was sceptical when got my first gym pass. started my journey with friend and ended up with my gym routine. i like puregym in ashton, theres alway clean, trainers are kind and helpful. there is variety of machines and huge choice of equipment for exercises. also you can choose classes you prefer, because there is huge choice."
3,2023-07-03,Just a standard gym,just a standard gym nothing special.  you pay online. and just go do your thing. said to have air conditioning but doesnt seen to do anything.
5,2023-07-09,Perfect gym,"perfect gym. positive atmosphere, 24x7 access, nice arrangent and administration. i dont need trainers, but still the staff is approachable and cooperative. i never get time to attain classes but i am sure they will be full of energy and fun (visual observations). highly recommend. stay fit."
5,2023-07-04,Great environment,"great environment. limited by space. but great for a quick workout, after work. would be nice, if all the cardio equipment was updated."
4,2023-07-04,Good system of entry,"good system of entry, quality equipment. my only concerns are not being able to get on the pump classes due to them being fully booked and the volume of the music in the gym being too loud, considering that most gym goers have their own headphones and music."
4,2023-07-09,The 24/7 approach is a good strategy,"the 24/7 approach is a good strategy, scanning codes to tutor and guide to the use of equipment, informing the users of when staff are unavailable, and regularly updating users of emergency strategy."
5,2023-07-04,Good atmosphere,"good atmosphere, clean and with knowledgeable staff."
4,2023-07-04,Good gym with great staff,it’s a really good gym with great staff on hand to help if needed. it can be really busy after 5pm and you find yourself walking around waiting for equipment. i would say the only improvements are the changing rooms/ mental toilets cleanliness- they are mostly smelly and dirty due to the high foot fall and they have turned the water temp in the shower down and there freezing. also the water machine is always out of flavouring
5,2023-07-04,Feels Good.,"clean,tidy and rewarding."
5,2023-07-05,All trainers are extremely welcoming,"all trainers are extremely welcoming, friendly and willing to chat/get to know you. i’m training with a pt and it’s been amazing and the overall atmosphere here is really great. training fit to suit me and i’ve made huge progress"

4,2023-07-04,It’s a decent size gym,"it’s a decent size gym, could’ve utilised the space more of the upstairs by adding more floor room up there. the car park situation is a nightmare had 2 tickets off the car park company not the gym."
1,2023-02-18,Extremely expensive prices that I can't…,"extremely expensive prices that i cant afford, you have to pay for plus which is £36 a month just to be able to use the yanga water drink machine which isnt ven in some puregyms. the core prices arent any better at £30 but you get less benefits than plus. the off-peak option is £22. which is a standard high price at other gyms. but puregym gives us much less benefits with that option so we dont get to go gym what times we want and have to fit their timetable which isnt clear anyway. when puregym has discounts or deals, they only do it for a select few gyms. also the prices change on the location instead of puregym having standard prices across board. if i wanted to downgrade there isnt benefits to that and if i wanted to cancel as you can only freeze so many times and they charge you if you do it close to the date. i will have to pay another £20 joining fee, so no loyalty to customers."

1,2023-07-05,Doesn’t accommodate working mothers,"doesn’t accommodate working mothers. due to unexpected child illness i was unable to cancel the classes booked enough in advance. (my crystal ball didn’t show that my nursery would call to say my child was not well and i had to pick them up) so i am now ‘banned’ from booking classes and any future bookings have been cancelled for 8 days. there needs to be some flexibility on this draconian rule, as there were still ample places on the classes i had booked. maybe have a think puregym of how you support hard working mothers who want to exercise for mental and physical fitness, not just your typical male gym attendee."

2,2023-07-04,Water temperature of Showers,"water temperature of showers , water is always tepid at best! the generic explanation provided is not helpful instead the temperature needs to be turned up enough so you can have a reasonable shower after workout . equipment is dated abd plance is often dirty especially ladies changing areas and toilets"
4,2023-07-05,The gym as a whole is great,"the gym as a whole is great, cheap and cheerful but the cleanliness needs improvement. for instance i have been going since the gym opened and in the early days there was an uninvited guest in the ladies changing room of the 8 legged variety.. rip mr spider, but the stain from said spider is still on the changing room floor 6 weeks later which makes me question if the floor has actually been cleaned? the showers in the ladies i feel should be cleaned on a daily basis, not sure how often they are done but when you use the same shower everyday you tend to get to know it well! i would not shower now without my trusty flip flops. the machines also could do with a regular wipe down.. id be happy to do this myself (as im sure others would) before i use a machine if there were some wipes provided. the location of the gym is fab as is the amount of parking, my only real issue is the cleanliness, sort this out and it will be 5*."

3,2023-07-04,The value for money is great but cleanliness not a priority,the value for money is great. however i do question the lack of paper towel for cleaning the machines. in such a busy gym with so few staff many of the machines are covered in sweat - this is not hygienic. i have mentioned it before and was told it was partly to help with the environment and stopping waste. surely recycled paper towel could be sourced. sorry it’s my only gripe but quite an annoying one as when i use the gym it’s very busy!

2,2023-07-04,Broken equipment,a lot of the machines are either in a state of disrepair (meaning they’re technically useable but functionality pointless/dangerous) or just broken. the leg curl machine has also been completely out of action for what seems like months now.

3,2023-07-04,As a gym member,"as a gym member, my experience has been a mixed bag. while the gym manager displays professionalism, (gym manager 100/100) i have noticed that the staff can be a bit bizarre. i have overheard them calling gym members, including myself, by different names, which is both uncomfortable and disrespectful. it is disheartening to hear such unprofessional behavior from staff members during my workouts. it not only creates an uncomfortable atmosphere but also undermines the trust and respect that should exist between staff and members. i hope the management addresses this issue and ensures a more respectful environment for all gym members."
2,2023-07-04,Updated gym,"the showers setting cycle from freezing to warm, which is uncomfortable. maybe this is the intent, but it leads to a poor experience.  not enough benches in the male changing rooms, so at busy times theres not enough space to change.  the private changing cubicles in the male changing rooms are too small, making them impractical to use.  not enough new equipment added for legs during refurb compared to other gyms."
3,2023-07-04,Machines broken and out of use for too…,"machines broken and out of use for too long, i’d question frequency of cleaning the gym (eg i left as tissue in a cup holder on a treadmill dnd it was still there 2-3 days later). also quite recently a treadmill generated an error code whilst in the max incline position. it stayed in the position for several days. everything else is great"
3,2023-07-04,Alright for price but hard to enjoy.,more times than not the flavours in the water machine are out. you cant do anything about it because once youve dispensed a drink you then cant get another for 20 minutes. the pts basically section of a part of the gym so i cant do my routine half of the sessions i go in and they keep sending adverts out to get more members when you cant even get on the equipment.

3,2023-07-07,Not a fan of the new arrangement of the gym equipment.,"have used the ashton gym for a few years now, but this review is due to the rearrangement of the gym equipment- i am not a happy bunny. the increased space between machines is good, but as i am predominantly a cardio machine user -moving all the treadmills downstairs and moving the free weights downstairs is annoying when all the other machines i use are upstairs. to get 3 kg weights today, i had to walk all the way through the class downstairs to get a pair -both sets were situated there, instead of in the main gym. previously, i could do all of my workout upstairs - on the same floor - really convenient. the new arrangement means i will be up and down those stairs like a fiddlers elbow-which yes means more exercise (good), but it could mean more traffic on the stairs and my work out will take more time as i am roaming all over the gym to find various machines/ equipment. denton have a better set up with regards to arranging equipment- i can get on all of the cardio machines on the same floor."

1,2023-07-04,Classes charge,"i have been with pure gym tcr for over a year now. i was enjoying all the classes and instructors and it is very disappointing to see that some of the best classes (step - zumba - pilates - yoga) with external instructors, which were sold out every week are now charged extra. it is a shame to add an extra cost to these classes when they are clearly super popular and only giving 2-weeks’ notice to the gym members. please do reconsider as many people already thinking to go to another gym due to these extremely unconscious decisions."

3,2023-07-04,It's a good gym in general,"its a good gym in general , clean , pretty well equipped and a lot of space. it can get very busy at times , to the point where the weights room can feel very cramped, if you pick a time wisely youll have a good workout. my biggest issue with this gym is unfortunately some of the members , they do not understand gym etiquette at all , weights not replaced , weight stacks remaining on racks etc. i have witnessed downright dangerous actions , such as throwing down of weights after sets which end up nearly hitting other members , rolling of weights across the whole gym floor. when some members work out in packs it can be intimidating . i know the staff are aware of these issues but im sure it can be difficult for them to keep the members in order. if you can zone out  from some of them members youll enjoy the gym."
3,2023-07-04,Would be an excellent gym but for the loud music,"the music is very loud. i like working  out listening to podcasts but this is impossible with the loud blaring music.  once the personal trainers come it’s even worse as they start blasting their own music to seemingly compete with the already loud music. ambient music is good but no need for it to be so loud, so early in the morning. besides this, the gym is very clean, well equipped & the staff generally helpful"

2,2023-07-03,Grimsby has no air con.,"grimsby branch is clearly trying to save on their electric bill as their air conditioning is essentially non existent. the equipments as good as any other gym but as we enter summer its almost impossible to do cardio as im sweating so much i cant physically see due to it covering my eyes. again, was nothing like this in the colder seasons but as the weather warms, its unbearable to do much in there. i like the freedom that puregym offers as a place to exercise at any time of day, however i will absolutely be looking elsewhere if this keeps up as i genuinely cannot exercise in that heat!"
4,2023-07-07,A great place maintain fitness.,"the gym is good to attend with ample parking and ease of access via the puregym app. the training area is spacious, well maintained and clean. there is a good selection of equipment for both cardio and strengthening. all the staff are friendly and approachable. the only down side is that, the male changing rooms often smells from the shower cubicles and urinals. there are some gym members that do not respect this area. it is not the gyms staff responsibility to clean after these people and maybe some well placed signs as a reminder may help. overall a great place to train and i am certainly happy to maintain my membership."
3,2023-07-04,Could improve,"can get too overcrowded at times, machines being unavailable due to a lack of maintenance isnt ideal, also theres rarely any sanitiser available to wipe down a station after finishing the workout."

4,2023-07-04,Really impressed with PureGym,"really impressed with puregym. its clean, with a good range of free-weights and machines. the phone app is brilliant in letting me know how busy it is, so i can plan my visit accordingly.  the shower facilities are also excellent.  the staff are polite and pleasant.  the cleaning staff are also pleasant and professional. i really recommend the gym.so why have i put only a four star? where can they improve? well, its been 5 weeks since one of the shower doors hasnt been fixed, so one of the showers is out of action. there are 3 showers in the mens changing rooms, so one of them not working makes a difference in busy periods. on three occasions in the last couple of weeks, whilst there on a late night (unstaffed) visit, there have been a couple of lads walking around with their tops off, which creates a bit of a hostile atmosphere.  and theres the usual gym problem of some of the younger users who often seem to struggle to tidy up weights that theyve used. none of this ruins my life (albeit, it does slow down my movement from one exercise to another),  but think its important to explain why this isnt a five star review....which it would be, if those issues where resolved."

3,2023-07-03,Shame it's all managed online.,good range of equipment and plenty to use and friendly gym-goers at the anlaby branch. didnt like the lack of staffing and having to enter and exit through keycode single doors that only admit one person at a time. always felt a bit unnerved and claustrophobic inside knowing in an emergency it would be difficult for people to get out in haste. around my 10th vist my app decided i was no longer able to use the regular door and i was basically stuck inside. i couldnt find any staff to unlock the door or explain why the app was telling me i could no longer use the door. eventually another gym goer was kind enough to use her code so i could leave. after that i decided the set up really isnt for me.

3,2023-07-03,Great PTs and team members but needs a revamp!,"this puregym is very easy to access, is generally well maintained when team members are around to return weights and equipment. i think the gym is well overdue a renovation and could be improved a lot by expanding the weights area and removing the downstairs treadmills. on a weekday evening you end up hanging around waiting for a bench to open up, while most of the cardio equipment is unused. want to really commend the team at puregym runcorn for doing their best to make it a nice place to work out in (could try and keep the music down a bit though…😂)!"

4,2023-07-03,I love this gym,"i love this gym.  it is inclusive, safe, and the staff are approachable when needed.  great selection of machines and the weights area is more than adequate.  i only have one small gripe, its that the showers no longer heat up and are literally about 30 - 40 seconds before they turn off again.  i use the gym before work, which means when i hit the showers i am getting ready for the office.  id just like the showers to be warmer and last for a little longer.  everything else is excellent."

3,2023-07-05,lack of variety in classes,"i find that over the last six months the variety of the classes has dropped. there are no free stretch, yoga, pilates classes or dance classes, step or aerobics and body combat classes now. all of these used to be an integral part of the timetable. i think this is due to a lack of suitably qualified instructor. those that are there work hard but the classes are all very similar in content whatever name they are given."
2,2023-07-07,Improvements required,"normally, i never leave a negative review as i dont like to be a karen. however, i believe i should raise the concerns i have with the facility in order for it to be rectified. ive been a member of another gym for 10 years cant fault it apart from its not 24 hours and no longer accommodates my life style. i have been to several other gyms along side my original gym membership to find the one that will suit me. i will cancel my other membership once im happy ive found the gym for me.  out of all the gyms ive tried all of which are your competitors, i have to say your gym comes out on top and im keen to make the move to your gym permanent as long as these issues are looked into.  now i can cope with the fact the air con isnt cold enough and its hot in your gym. breaking a sweat in a gym is the aim anyway so i can live with that.  i love the big competition squat rack and weight plates. the only issue i have is the fact i have always trained on my own. never bothered with a gym partner as gym time is my time. this means i have to watch my own form and correct myself when my lift isnt going to plan. i have always been fine with solo training and always managed to lift correctly and safely. this is only been possible with the use of a large mirror like you already have in certain locations. i carry out big compound lifts on your squat racks and would feel much better with the use of a mirror.  now the reason why i have given a two star rating is down to the fact i love your gym and facility and it suits my needs perfectly apart from the issues listed above. now i can just about deal with everything ive mentioned so far. now what i cant cope with and i cant stress this enough is the lack of cleanliness in the male changing rooms.  i have been a member of your gym since the 7th of june and from day one the hand dryer is out of order. thats not an issue things break, but at least provide an alternative way of drying your hands while the hand dryer is out of use. not really a fan of trying to lift weights with moist hands.  the dryer is not my major cleanliness concern. the fact that since the 7th of june you have had a blood stain on the wall of the cubical is unacceptable. i know its a blood stain as it was all over the toilet on the 7th when i went to use the facility and has since been cleaned off everywhere but the wall. we are now on the 29th of june. we have had a blood stained wall for 23 days. i am aware the gym is not always manned by staff, but id like to think something as like that would be addressed on the day it happened. this is not only disgusting but a health hazard to others since its directly below the toilet paper dispenser.  i have taken photos of the facility with blood stain and dates the photos were taken circled. unfortunately i can’t upload with this review but will happily send them to who ever requires them. i hope as a company you take this as positive feedback to improve on, and will look into some of these issues for the benefit of me and other members. at a minimum id expect the blood to be cleaned and a toilet cleanliness rota put in place. i apologise for being a karen as it’s not normally my nature how ever as a company i believe feedback is important. i will send a copy of this via email also to ensure it gets to who it needs to.  thank you  mac (the karen)"

3,2023-07-05,I have spend over a year now at runcorn…,i have spend over a year now at runcorn gym. my time here has been brilliant and a joy to spend time there but recently my time there is off putting. there has been a lot of youngsters attending the gym and it seems like im back at school. there will be around 10 to fifteen lads hanging round the male changing rooms. some are smoking vapes and some are punching holes in the walls. i have also witnessed some lads deliberately breaking some of the treadmill machines and other equipment. i have spoke to a few members about the situation there and they are also fed up with the youngsters. me personally i think most of them dont even pay to use the gym. i hear alot of them talking about secret codes so they can gain access for free. me personally im getting sick of them just hanging around the equipment so you cant use it and when you ask if its free to use they just pretend to use it. its not a nice place to be at the moment. 😞

3,2023-07-04,The cleanliness of the gym has taken a…,"the cleanliness of the gym has taken a downturn, tonight all the urinals were blocked leaving only the one cubical for approximately 40 men to use then we couldn’t wash our hands, not very nice when you are sharing weights and let’s be honest, some people are not clean at the best of times. the temperature is always hot, air conditioning never seems to be set low enough especially at peak times. the staff are fabulous the machines are good. peak times can be very busy."
4,2023-07-05,Good gym,good gym. calm even if music a bit loud sometimes. and could ask people not to sit on equipment looking at their phones while others are waiting
5,2023-07-06,Building myself,it was great experience simply because it was very easy to access and extremely comfy.i guess it would be intresting journey of building myself from the beginning.

2,2023-07-04,The temperature is rubbish with very…,"the temperature is rubbish with very poor air  conditioning, far too warm and humidity making it difficult to workout.  the cleaning unit have been removed why as plenty of your customers still use them. the bath gym needs a good clean with dirty equipment & changing rooms."
1,2023-05-18,Classes get cancelled as they should start!,i could only occasionally make classes at puregym. lost trust in booking sessions as they were cancelled one minute before they ‘began’. i contacted customer services and no refund or apology was offered. waste of time.  don’t seem to take care of customers any longer.
2,2023-07-05,Gone downhill,"really enjoyed the gym, there was a good choice of classes spread fairly across the week to accommodate all members. not so much now. lots of good instructors have left and gone elsewhere. between that and other staffing issues, class timetables and choice of classes have changed to the detriment of members. ive raised this with management, and whilst i accept there are constraints placed on individual clubs in terms of shifts, which can affect class availability, there is a clear lack of forward planning and a reluctance to accept that instructors being unwilling to take certain classes impacts on members experience. perhaps puregym should ask themselves why instructors are leaving..."
1,2023-06-28,"Zero Joining Fee, More Like Zero Respect. 10 Years of Loyalty = Absolutely Nothing.","i was a member of puregym for almost 10 years and happily so. i even upgraded to the premium membership as well last year and hired a pt and i feel like i can confidently say that i am a gym rat as i go very frequently. i have had friends and family tell me many times about various deals at other gyms that would offer me more value for money and better prices for different pts with proven results over the months and years, but out of good will i decided to stay loyal to puregym. to the point that i managed to convince various friends of mine to come over also this past year after years of workouts. this past month however, i feel like i have been let down drastically and my loyalty has all been for nothing. in the whole time i have been a member at your gym, i have stuck to my payments and been on time without asking for any kind of favour or making any kind of complaint. 2 weeks ago, i made it known that i would struggle for the first time due to the recent cost of living, and that my payment was going to be delayed by only a few hours, if that until my pay check came through and i tried to ask what could be done to make sure i wasnt either charged extra or penalised for this. so you can imagine my disappointment when i was bluntly told that there would be no help granted in regards to this situation without any attempt at a solution. so i had no choice but to cancel my membership to make sure i could get through last month without incurring any extra charges. since then i have found another gym which i am now signed up to, so i assumed that would be the end of this saga that i have been through these past few weeks. apparently this is not the case as i still have to pay one last month to my pt despite being at a completely different gym! i dont care about being compensated for any funds if anybody should finally deem it necessary. its been made perfectly clear to me in the recent days that my financial situation isnt being taken seriously by puregym and that neither are your customers if this is how a long time and loyal member of your gym can be treated. i 100% will not be going back once this is over and i hope nobody else has to go through this disappointment and betrayal of trust and loyalty either."
3,2023-07-04,Was very over crowded and busy,was very over crowded and busy. not the best for people like myself with anxiety but i suppose you don’t have much control over that
5,2023-07-06,I think the classes are really good,"i think the classes are really good, especially ethans as one of your newest member of staff i feel he has grown in confidence and all his classes are delivered to a high standard and he is such a lovely, enthusiastic and encouraging young man and i look forward to his classes. i also like sues, joshs, nathans and leahs classes on an evening. however, i would like to see more variety after 6:30 as we still only seem to do bodytone and legs, bums and tums. there are no bootcamps, circuits, kettlebells, metcon or burn its etc on an evening for working people only through the day. overall i am very happy with the classes i do and i look forward to going to the gym. it is also a good social network and a friendly environment."
4,2023-07-05,Turn down the volume,"the gym is really good, happy with equipment, price and cleanliness. my only criticism is how loud the classes are. i can hear the spin class music while listening to my own music in headphone, and the instructor shouting at regular intervals. i appreciate that it’s meant to be motivating, but it really is excessive, especially the shouting."

3,2023-07-01,"Just ""ok""","its not a bad gym, but they could have made better decisions.  the location is great, the parking is free and ample, and you have almost every machine and tool you need to for a great workout.   that said:its open plan and the layout is poor with the way too many treadmills facing the equipment.they seem to have switched the ac off to save money?  or maybe it no longer works?  either way the place gets hot.  the water fountains and that flavoured-water machine also dont put out anything youd call ""cold"".its certainly oversubscribed with children who like to watch videos while parked on machines.  i dont expect the staff - themselves very young adults - to do anything about that, but by not putting up a sign or two, it looks like theyre endorsing it."

5,2023-07-03,PureGym gyms are the best.,"i have been weight training for well over 50 years, i’ve used countless gyms in that time.  puregym are the best that i’ve used and that includes gyms in other countries. brilliant equipment, lovely staff and very clean.  the one downside and this is also true of gyms that i use in spain, is the fact that other gym users sit on the equipment to use their phones, the other day i saw 6 people sat on benches and stood next to equipment for 30 minutes, maybe more on their phones."

3,2023-06-29,On the whole PureGym is a good gym…,"on the whole puregym is a good gym where the staff and members are friendly, or they are at the time i go which is between 5am and 7am of a morning. however, the down time on broken equipment can be a long time before it is repaired which can be an inconvenience when there is only the one machine. the leg curl machine has been broken for a couple of months now and they only have one of these. during the hot mornings has been hell with no air conditioning on. with this being a 24hr gym i get to go at the times that suit me and the membership price is very competitive with different options, and this is the bottom line, you get what you pay for, you cant expect 5star service when paying 1 star prices."
2,2023-07-05,Downhill journey,"unfortunately this gym has really gone downhill since a change in management in early 2023. the gym struggles with general cleanliness, especially in the changing rooms, and passive-aggressive signs about reracking weights are ignored, even by the in-house pts. the music is far too loud, it is heard even over closed ear headphones, and equipment is regularly broken for extended periods"

5,2023-07-05,Great value for money compared to other…,"great value for money compared to other gyms. is it the plushest? no. does it have the latest tech? no. is it the cleanest? no (especially in evenings). but its not unclean either and the range of equipment (both machine and freeweights) is very good. maintenance is okay but they would lose 1/2 a star on that one if i could select 4.5 stars instead of 5 as there is always some cardio on the blink which stays that way for a week or so and some of the elliptical trainers have needed some attention for a while (bit clunky). does get busy in the evenings with the annoying younger crowd (5 or 6 taking turns on one station - tossers, or some tart with her camera set up for the perfect insta post taking up more space than necessary) but daytimes and overnights have sensible numbers or normal people and you can usually find space to do your thing. staff/pts are friendly and helpful during the day (unmanned at night), and the 24 hour access is a big plus. if you rate your gyms on value for money, they are at the top of the list as far as im concerned."
3,2023-07-04,Nice but lacks cleanliness,"nice gym , spacious and good ventilation. machinery and toilets are often dirty...."

2,2023-07-04,Grace period,"as a dedicated member of puregym woolwich, i would like to request a grace period for situations when the direct debit payment does not go through successfully. it would be greatly appreciated if puregym could provide a brief window of time to rectify any payment issues before membership cancellation occurs. additionally, i kindly request a reminder notification for upcoming payment due dates to ensure timely payments and a better user experience.  also, the gym floor is not flat, which makes it difficult when strength training and causes muscle imbalance."
1,2023-07-05,Going from bad to worse :(,"standard pure gym and you get what you pay for but since ive been going in the last 6 months the toilets have been out of service maybe 5 times? the showers are also frequently broken and today they smelled strongly of sewage. tried to find a staff member to tell but none in sight. equipment is always broken. they have signed on too many members for a gym of this size as it is always overcrowded. for some reason in the past couple of weeks theyve removed all the sanitation points so you cant even spray down equipment after you use it. its always absolutely boiling as well, they seem to be scared to put the air con on. the manager is also really rude and told me im not allowed to use the steps in the free weights room, which is really strange as ive been to lots of other puregyms and this has never been an issue. instead she told me to use a box to do smith machine step ups, but boxes arent stable at all? not sure if shes ever done this exercise herself but her advice was rubbish. also she interrupted my friend at the start of a set - no gym etiquette at all from the manager of a gym? i could go on forever about the problems this gym has but clearly they dont care as bad reviews keep rolling in and no changes have been made."

4,2023-07-05,Thumbs up,the gym and the equipment are brilliant the changing rooms are great the fact that it 24/7 is fantastic the only thing i wish they had is cleaning facilities to wipe the machines even though it’s not compulsory anymore it would be good to have the option.
3,2023-07-05,To bright lights and colors on walls,"to bright lights and colors on walls. treadmills should be little more separate from rest of the gym just to give a little privacy.  at the moment they are in central area and along the windows.  some people may like to be watch by random strangers 🤪from street or in side gym personally prefer quiet darker corners its just feel more natural and comfortable aspecial when you steaming, red face covered with sweat😳 #after all thats whole point of it to go there. other than that decent equipment, clean and good parking 👍"
3,2023-07-06,PureGym Walton,"another trip to puregym walton-on-thames, it still baffles me as to why this gym is so expensive in comparison to other puregyms i have been to. for such a small gym which has a tiny male changing room and limited bike cardio equipment the price is way off what other gyms offer. i noticed today that the resistance equipment was very dusty and the music in the gym was particularly loud, which seems counter productive as 90% of the members had headphones on. i suppose the question will be asked, ‘why do i go to this gym?’ simple answer is, it opposite where i live and i would go to the gym if i had to make an effort to get there. however i don’t see why we pay so much for this particular puregym."
1,2023-07-06,Poor Gym not PureGym in Great Portland St.,"this puregym in great portland st (it is actually in cavendish mews) is unbearable during the summer month due their aircon not being able cope with the heat.  my husband and have been members for about 6 years and during this time, puregym has suffered from the same issues with the aircon and tv’s not working. the tv problems has been ongoing for about 3 years and the same excuse “we are waiting for parts to fix it”.  it is a basement gym, and as you enter it, the warmth and a strange decomposing smell greets you, most probably due to the lack of air circulation. it is not pleasant. the various lovely gym managers over the years have had the same problems with head office not caring about fixing the aircon and tv’s. it appears that the puregym head office is not interested in investing in this gym so that everything works as it should and member get what they have paid for through their membership.  all the staff are super friendly and it is a clean gym however the non-working aircon and tv’s makes a very poor gym.  i cannot recommend joining puregym during the summer months unless you like it very warm. the gym is fine during winter."

1,2023-07-05,Unserious gum,just such a horrible gym with 0 daylight through the whole building. it’s just benches for days with barely any machines. the machines they do have from “matrix” are terrible and do nothing for the muscle part you are training.  the stepper has been out of order for over a month now with no update when it will be fixed.  god forbid you forget your headphones because you’ll be forced to listen to the most unmotivating music. why do i want to hear taylor swift whilst working out?  it’s just such a horrible gym and should only be used as last resort.

2,2023-07-04,Good price poor quality,the first cardio room smells real bad and there’s a lot of black mould where the weight equipment is near the changing rooms
4,2023-07-06,Friendly employees,"friendly employees, and organized atmosphere, but lack of welcome to members, lack of effective wipes and ineffective cleaning station. weights and equipment a little bit disorganized in terms of equipment such as dumbbells, kettlebells, and barbell plates. also certain open areas had too much equipment in the space and certain attachments such as the barbell insertion was too close to the dumbell rack, along with an air bike being right next to the dumbbells."
4,2023-07-06,Great Gym,"this gym is great, i am part of the early morning lot lol, and met some great people. most of the staff are pleasant, however, the main two are kayley and k the pts. always go out of their way to smile and make you feel good and very approachable. only minors are, management could do with listening to customers as i have mentioned the state of mens changing room which is filthy most of the time with nothing being done, there is always a massive staff change since me being there and i feel that they could be looked after better and treated better if you want the honest truth as retention rate is not great. other than that great gym , spacious with great atmmosphere"

3,2023-07-05,Not the best but you’ll get by?,"general fitness, then the gym is fine. however the weight machines are not so good. designer taken the concept too far, there’s no real connection between machine and muscle. there’s far better machines out there! and considering majority of people in the gym are using the machines there’s only one of each! machine like chest press, shoulder press back pull down are most common exercises there should be more than one machine for each. it’s very hard to organise a body part workout due to the limited machines!!!!"

2,2023-07-04,Value for money but would rather pay a little more for quality,"classes are enjoyable but lacks free weights in the main gym. also lacks matting areas when classes are taking place. i find it impossible to have a nice shower after a workout as the shower heads are fixed at around 7ft so washing your hair is difficult as its a mere drizzle by the time the water gets to you. i realise it is not expensive in comparison to most gyms, however, the points mentioned above puts me off from going and i will also will not be renewing my membership."
2,2023-07-05,This is an opinion of a person who…,"this is an opinion of a person who doesnt matter the problem i have with cheap gyms is that it attracts weird people and gyms that want to make money obviously wont tell them off, but i feel like its time to tell the guy curling dumbbells that he needs to change out of jeans and we dont care if its just for the pump before a night out 🤣 staff basically should walk around from time to time and see whats going on not hide and sit on their phones"

3,2023-07-04,Lift not working,"lift not working, showers cold and no cleaning stations. edge lane liverpool. these things should have been sorted out before the venue opened. not safe or inclusive given equipment is on two floors. i have already spoken to the manager and there was no time scale given. he said he would contact me when the lift is operational. not a good look when someone with mobility issues sees the lift being used as a storage cupboard. not sure if this complies with dda legislation, the equality act or health and safety regulations. i am sure the health and safety executive would be unimpressed as well."

2,2023-07-05,Had to upgrade package just to breathe better in the gym,"i recently reactivated my membership with the off-peak package at pure gym enfield, enticed by its affordable price of £22. however, my experience has been far from satisfactory.  the main issue with the off-peak package is that it restricts users to access the gym only after 21:00. this limitation has resulted in overcrowding during the available hours, making it incredibly challenging to find any space, machines, or free weights to use. it defeats the purpose of a gym membership if you cannot utilise the facilities due to excessive demand.  pure gym enfield offers a solution to this problem by providing an upgrade option for an additional £7, allowing subscribers to access the facilities at any time. however, this feels like an unnecessary expense to overcome the gyms own overcrowding issue.  furthermore, i found the standards at the gym to be disappointing. the ventilation system appears to be inadequate, especially when the air conditioning is not in operation. poor ventilation poses a potential health and safety risk, particularly during intense workout sessions when fresh airflow is crucial.  overall, my experience at pure gym enfield has been unsatisfactory. the overcrowding issue during off-peak hours, coupled with the need to pay extra for a better workout experience, has left me disappointed. the subpar ventilation system further exacerbates the problems and raises concerns about the gyms commitment to its members well-being.  i hope that pure gym enfield takes these issues into consideration and makes the necessary improvements to provide a better experience for its members."

4,2023-07-04,Welcoming but needs more overseeing by staff,"it can be overcrowded sometimes, with people sitting on the equipment using their phones and not actually doing anything. it makes it difficult to access the equipment. some people leave their belongings on certain machines and move about the gym, which also leaves some equipment unusable. the rowing machines face the wall which can be quite boring when using them. there is one in the middle of the floor but this space is usually busy."
5,2023-07-04,Have never joined a gym before,"i had never been a member of a gym before but puregym makes it so comfortable and rewarding to. i love the app and all of its features, i love being able to book classes (that is big for me whilst i am gaining confidence in attending a gym) the class instructors are all great. enthusiastic, motivating and super friendly. really great environment for anyone wanting to workout at all fitness levels"

4,2023-07-05,"Fantastic Gym with Top-Notch Equipment, but Limited Availability","i recently joined the new gym in town and wanted to share my experience. overall, i am thoroughly impressed with the facility and the top-notch equipment they provide. however, there is one major drawback that i must mention—the limited availability due to its popularity.  lets start with the positives. the gym boasts an extensive range of state-of-the-art exercise equipment. from cardio machines to free weights and resistance training, they have everything you need for a comprehensive workout. the equipment is well-maintained, and you can tell that the gym management takes pride in providing a high-quality fitness experience.  the gym itself is spacious, clean, and well-designed. it creates an inviting atmosphere that motivates you to push your limits and achieve your fitness goals. the staff members are friendly, knowledgeable, and always ready to assist you if needed. the cleanliness of the facility is commendable, with staff regularly sanitizing equipment and maintaining a hygienic environment.  now, lets address the issue of limited availability. due to the gyms popularity and the sheer number of members, finding an open spot during peak hours can be quite challenging. the gym gets very busy, and sometimes it feels overcrowded, especially during evenings and weekends. this can be a bit frustrating, as it may lead to longer wait times for machines or difficulty accessing certain areas of the gym.  to their credit, the gym management is aware of this problem and actively working on solutions. they have introduced online booking systems and are considering expanding their facilities to accommodate more members. however, it will take some time before these measures fully alleviate the issue. in the meantime, it would be wise to plan your visits during off-peak hours if possible.  despite the availability issue, i would still highly recommend this gym for its exceptional equipment and overall quality. if you can manage to adjust your workout schedule or dont mind occasional waits, the benefits of training at this gym outweigh the inconvenience. just be prepared for the busy periods and plan your workouts accordingly.  in conclusion, this gym offers a fantastic fitness experience with top-notch equipment and a well-maintained facility. however, the limited availability due to high demand can be a challenge during peak hours. if youre willing to work around that, youll find a gym that provides an excellent environment for achieving your fitness goals."

2,2023-07-03,Broken equipment,i have been a member for two months and from my very first day the air conditioning had been broken and all that had been done to fix it is a bucket put underneath the unit to catch the water that constantly drips out of it. two machines have also remained broken since i joined which is frustrating as the gym certainly doesn’t have an abundance of equipment so when some breaks it has a major impact on the customers.

3,2023-07-04,More hands on staffing required.,"this gym has a good range of equipment and typically it is all in good working order and kept clean. two big problems, though, are that the bathrooms and changing room are always filthy (i would not feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat let a lone using one of the showers). the second is that there are frequently gym users being very anti-social (threatening, refusing to share equipment at busy times, or seriously misusing equipment or space). when i have complained to staff about this they did not regard it as their problem. it means the gym often has a negative atmosphere. in a space like this the culture of the users is lead by the staff, and is far more important than the quality of the equipment. please prioritise this."
3,2023-07-04,PureGym. Good but Bad.,"i have been a member of puregym for over 10 years and although it has been great for the most part, i have found that recently my membership has not allowed me to get into gyms that i have previously had access to and there has been no warning or communication to say that this is happening. this can be very embrassing and dishearting after making your way to the gym having been able to get in last week but you cant get in this week. an explanation would be helpful to know why this is the case.  also the state of the lockers in the mens changing rooms is terrible in the birmingham city centre puregym. more than half seem to have no lock on them."

2,2023-07-04,London Woolwich - Way too small,"this is pretty much the only gym in woolwich and it’s nowhere big enough to fit the number of people. whatever time you go, it’s busy. you don’t have to spend ages queuing but it’s not as seamless a session at other gyms, where there’s enough space and equipment to satisfy the demand.  as far as “budget” gym goes, pure gym is generally better than a better gym because of the opening times and more modern equipment, but doesn’t have as much variety as the gym"
3,2023-07-04,Cleanliness and not enough apparatus for weights,"there is only 1 cleaning station available for both 1st floor and ground floor, there should be more and more localised to the equipment so users can clean after use  there should be more weight lifting apparatus as there is always a queue to use these and maybe if one row of running machines were removed and the elliptical moved to that row, then more weight lifting apparatus could be installed"

3,2023-07-04,Over subscribed,"over subscribed, people unwilling to share equipment they just want to sit and use mobile phones."
5,2023-07-04,Good price and everything you need,lots of equipment and space to work out. you can always tell when dave is on shift as everything is all clean and tidy - not so much when he’s not around.
3,2023-07-04,My Opinion,"the facility is quite good and there’s not too many people most of the time, but i would like the to be more options for plyometric training."
3,2023-07-03,Air quality and fobs to enter,the air con or general air condition in the gym feels stuffy and sometimes sweaty smelling. the cardio equipment all faces blank walls with no viewing options or windows to look out on or tele to watch. and i think its bad you have to buy your own fob for easy gym access. it should come with membership like most other gyms. other than that staff are friendly and classes and the gym seem to be busy.

2,2023-07-04,Staff not engaging,"staff not engaging, sell too many memberships for available resistance equipment no direction for members training needs or assistance with exercise programs staff need to orchestrate members to create better training atmosphere outside of classes or paid pt sessions"
5,2023-07-04,Been a loyal member for years. For good reason.,love aylsham road. i enjoy all 3 gyms but ar is my fav. i made a comment before (for improvement in the toilets) but maybe didnt consider fully the very high daily footfall of members so its understandable that occasionally things arent 100%.
4,2023-07-04,pure gym give value for money but could be better,"pure gym give value for money, there is at times maintenance issues of equipment and facilities (toilets and wash rooms) i think we also need some different classes, yoga, pilates etc. could be via video link"

1,2023-07-03,Several Brocken Equipment,equipment not working when most of the problems are just batteries. keep receiving emails saying i did not cancel class when i did. restricting me from classes even though i’ve cancelled and classes are empty and only receive 5 people (cycle class). you are supposed to retain members not push them away from restricting them.

1,2023-07-03,Lucky it got 1 star- as no stars is not an option here,the machines are broken- the ceilings are broken-they dont fix them because the ceilings leak.  the studio floor has never had the floor laid properly and has bubbles in it that will trip and kill you as well as the studio being very poorly lit- because they dont want you to see the bubbles on the floor. the front door was broken for almost a year. only join if its the cheaper than the gym down the road.
5,2023-07-05,Great gym,"great gym, fab app, friendly staff, clean, secure, plenty of machines, varied equipment, open 24/7 what’s not to love??"

3,2023-07-04,Good but lack of cleaning stations,"the gym is a good size with plenty of equipment and the staff are friendly and helpful. major downside is the removal of all but one of the cleaning stations, would like to see these reinstated especially in the areas where there are benches and machines."
1,2023-07-03,The 4 hours cancellation of class…,the 4 hours cancellation of class bookings is unrealistic then to get blocked from booking classes is unacceptable especially if you only miss 3 in a 28 day period.
1,2023-07-02,Pure gym is bad,"weights are scattered everywhere you spend half the time looking for the weights you need, it’s stupid busy all the time which means your waiting for most of the machines you want to use additionally why so many treadmills you could get rid of at least half of them to make room for more cables which everyone uses or heck even a second leg extension machine considering there’s only one. poor gym overall would not recommend"

1,2023-07-03,Far too small,far too small. busy even at 6am.
3,2023-07-03,Rather dull,equipment fine but a tv monitor (cheap!) to take tedium out of repetitive training (cheaper gyms have them) would be very welcome – i resist coming to the gym due to the boredom of repetitive training. also bottles of cleaning fluid to wipe down machines.  puregym is a bit basic / clinical (albeit with insufficient cleaning fluid!) and it could be better & only about £200 would need to be spent!
5,2023-07-03,"💪I""ve got the power",right place for my fathy ass 😁💪 thank you
4,2023-07-03,Good class,"good class, but would like to see more variety of classes on the same day and not just a repeat of the same type of class 3 times on that day if possible."
4,2023-07-04,"Large, well appointed, friendly gym.","large space, very well equipped, high quality machines and free-weights, plus floor space for classes. for me (65yrs old), thumping music too loud and annoying. very busy during my one-day pass visit, but provision made for training at quieter periods. when busy, far too much distraction for me. but i imagine many younger people require a busy gym for motivation. i train at home in my garden on purpose built callisthenics bars and find this more to my liking than a chaotic gym, with all the noise, but i could adapt if i had to. great to see so many people working out in a friendly, high quality gym. good that there’s no contract involved."
4,2023-07-03,Great classes,great classes. drew ryan charon and sam l lead the way in their circuit and or spin classes.  it isn’t a 5 star review as the tech i.e. the music and sound in the spin class hasn’t been right for a while and they need to black out the light more to get more of an experience.
3,2023-07-03,Moon carpark,"most of the equipment is good  car park is like driving on the moon, never seen so many potholes in such a small car park, its impossible to avoid smashing your car in them.  vending machines regularly empty or broken"

3,2023-07-03,The gym is a good one as timings,"the gym is a good one as timings , price and size are good. the staff are good and approachable. whats letting it down is that some of the equipment like rowers are getting tired and it would be nice to have more spin bikes outside of the studio as not everyone can get to the start of a class."
5,2023-07-03,#1 gym,"the best gym i know, it has the best equipment and the staff as well as management are friendly and helpful. the gym is incredibly clean and organised. the class sessions especially make the gym so much more fun!"
2,2023-07-04,Not the cleanest of gyms I’m afraid,"so i was recently asked by pure gym to be submit my feedback following a recent visit. i highlighted the lack of cleaning stations and cleaning products in the gym . stephen , responded with the usual blah blah, so i asked stephen ( deputy manager ) if pure gym values its members health, and that bacteria, germs and goodness what are still rife .. sadly no response. i asked stephen to explain why there are no cleaning stations in the ladies gym , his response .. ‘they can be found in the main part of the gym’. which is a male dominated area! i highlighted this too and no response. so stephen speaking on behalf of a large conglomerate as pure gym has decided that paying women members who choose to remain in the ladies area do not warrant a hygiene station. - comment to stephen  please explain why there is no cleaning station available in the ladies gym? why are you ok for bacteria , germs, sweat etc to be passed from person to machine to person again?  most gyms would have signs to say wipe down after use?   and stephen’s response:  there is a cleaning station on the main floor which everyone can use. everything can be found in the terms and conditions when people sign up regarding wiping down !  unbelievable completely ignoring the seriousness of the issue.  thanks for your response, but you cannot have visited the park royal gym recently. as you said during the pandemic time your hygiene standards were exemplary, but now they are substandard and your members health and wellbeing is not important!! it’s a cost saving exercise and wish you’d just admit this. sadly, your response says a lot and i’m afraid you will lose another member. i’d be interested to see this government guidelines you mentioned as i’m unable to locate it on gov.uk .  sadly park royal , is no where near the hygiene levels mentioned by others.. this is what is supposed todo according to sports and england dept  ensure clean surfaces and equipment  you must make sure that any equipment provided as part of your activity is cleaned frequently with the appropriate products, such as disinfectant wipes.  shared equipment provided by the venue or organisation must periodically be washed thoroughly."
5,2023-07-03,"Great gym, excellent range of classes",excellent classes with a really varied timetable. much better class and machine availability than in more expensive gyms locally.  the staff are excellent and always make you feel welcome.

3,2023-07-03,Trying to find staff is a nightmare,"trying to find staff is a nightmare, they need to fit some sort of bell at the desk and then when you go up to a staff member/pt they are really rude and abrupt. the caliber of staff from last year to this year just seems to have gone downhill massively, but you get what you pay for it’s a cheap gym so you get what you pay for, more expensive gyms have a much batter atmosphere from the staff and they’re far more approachable."

1,2023-07-03,Nothing positive,i am trying to think of anything positive look at the end of the day i use the gym four times a week but i only use it as i am homeless at the moment and its convenient for my needs at this moment in time like i was in the gym the other day sunday i think and i saw three teenage lads on the squat rack not using it properly or knowing how to squat one of the instructors walked passed and said something to them about using it incorrectly but then walked off to chat some bird up on one of the machines he could have taken a minute to help these lads it was only there second time at a gym i ended up showing them the basics maybe its not the instructors job but a minute of help and knowledge goes along way
3,2023-07-03,It’s fine when not too busy,"it’s fine when not too busy. when busy it gets frustrating when others sit on machines for ages just scrolling their phones. there should be some protocol around this. also, the balance of machinery isn’t great. loads for arms & shoulders, only one abdominal crunch, one leg press on the first floor."

2,2023-06-17,Gym Environment,the gym classes are far too noisy. the music and instructors voices are so loud it’s deafening at the other end of the gym and so much worse if one is trying to work out at the the same location. the environment and air quality can sometimes be very poor.

2,2023-07-03,Filled to brim with male juiceheads.,"firstly, no complaints about the equipment or the staff - theres great choices and the staff are polite. however, the gym is stuffed to the brim of juice head men and young boys that takeover any kind of weight-involved equipment, and stare at girls throughout their visit, intimidating them and stopping them from considering using the equipment. there needs to be a ladies section, or a ladies day/specific hours. i understand its a mixed gym, but its predominantly men, because of how uncomfortable they make the visits for women. i am strongly considering leaving already after only a month because all i feel i can do is cardio for 30 minutes then leave and try to do extra bits at home. considering the price, there needs to be more put in place to make it accessible for both genders. its targeted to men - pure and simple. im going to likely pay a higher monthly payment for a gym with a ladies section of the gym. we lift weights too."

5,2023-05-01,Personal Training with Dannie,"i feel honoured to have had dannie not only as a personal trainer but also a friend. i begun training with dannie earlier this year for about 2 months. as a student, dannie catered a training regime that worked out my hectic routine and taught me the importance of being disciplined with my personal training. dannie was able to quickly identify that i was a lot stronger than i thought i was and pushed me in the right way possible. post training with her, i attend her ‘burn-it’ class which is an amazingly well crafted hiit class that i thoroughly enjoy. she always approaches me when she sees me in the gym. she truly is an inspiration for those around her and i cannot recommend her enough. thank you dannie for everything you have taught me :)"

2,2023-07-03,Rather disappointing experience with…,"rather disappointing experience with this gym. no management in the gyms is not the greatest to express your problems as most of them are staffless. customer service isnt too great either as it is via twitter etc which takes a few days too respond, its easier to do live chat or have a phone number. changed my home gym as a plus member, where it told me the price would stay the same at 30.99 per month, i then find i was charged 46.98 which it said no such thing about. few weeks later i decided to cancel my membership and use up the remaining days i have with friends as i have the bring a buddy option as being a plus member. however, after checking my account, i can see that the option for bringing a buddy has been taken down as it would not let me sign somebody else up which is frustrating considering i have paid to have those benefits for the whole month and just because i have decided to cancel it goes. that should not be happening just because i have cancelled."
2,2023-07-03,Prices increasing but standards decreasing.,there have been 2 price increases in less than a year but at the same time the overall standard of the gym has decreased.  men’s toilet area is often in a poor state.  when machines break down they are often out of action for many weeks.  some days the music is not on.  over the past few years i have written very positive reviews but unfortunately standards have dropped. i think is more down to pure gym as a company and not the staff and personal trainers at bramley as the ones i speak to are very friendly.  the one thing the gym has that is still fantastic is ingrida who has always been very friendly and helpful and is the sort of person that pure gym is very lucky to have working for them.  as my review is for pure gym i can only give it 2 stars. if it was for just ingrida i would give it 5 stars.

2,2023-04-30,Not safe,"overall a good gym. very busy at times. the biggest problem here were fellow members. especially as i like to go late at night 10pm onwards, the gym seems to attract a seedy crowd with some people obviously not meeting the minimum age requirement. there is supposed to be a cctv team monitoring things out of hours but this clearly is not happening. people are free to get loud, wrestle on the floor, throw the swiss balls where others are working out and even smoke in the gym, swear at fellow members and get up to other stuff. the management seems reluctant to address these issues, which may be because some of the unruly members are friends with them. they expect that you will attend at a time when they are in to discuss. who has time for this? you need to make sure that the gym rules are implemented so that people can attend hassle-free. otherwise, what is the point in having such rules? at times ive felt very unsafe here. i hope that they clean up their act, including the toilets."

2,2023-06-30,PureGym Worcester hot and stuffy,"i’ve been a member for over five years and have been pretty happy with the worcester branch until this year. my issue is with the air quality and temperature. some days, it’s like walking into a sauna. it’s often humid, smells sweaty and is too warm to be able to train effectively. this isn’t usually on very hot days. yesterday (30/06/23) was so bad, i didn’t train and left after speaking to the manager. i have asthma and started to feel breathless after just a few minutes inside the gym. (my asthma is well-regulated and i always check my sp02 before and after entering the gym.) my peak flow was fine but the stuffy air made me feel faint quite quickly.) i’ve spoken to the manager on various occasions about the inconsistency of the gym’s air quality and temperature, and he has told me that the air-con is set to a minimum of 20 degrees. this is warm for a gym and especially uncomfortable for high intensity cardio exercise. he told me that he can’t change the temperature. pure gym has stated on twitter that individual gym managers control their gym’s temperature and ventilation system; there is no company policy that dictates it. according to conor the manager, this is the temperature that keeps the bills down and most people don’t complain because they don’t do cardio. he can’t change it because he won’t change it, is his explanation in a nutshell. i’m a pt (and also exercise referral qualified) so am well aware of the impact on physical performance as temperature progresses. for people who want to run, row, cycle etc, it’s really uncomfortable and can cause faintness, with the potential for injury. i’m pretty close to cancelling my membership at this point, having tried unsuccessfully to deal with this directly.  update gym temperature 04/07/23: 22 degrees"

2,2023-06-30,Cleanliness,the only complaint i have regarding the gym are the changing rooms and showers. recently it has been very stuffy and warm in the changing rooms. you could do with putting on air condition in the changing rooms. also the shower cubicles need unblocking and making sure they are clean. i appreciate you are trying to keep costs low and this is why youve reduced the water temperature and pressure. but having to shower in an unclean shower cubicle is not acceptable. i hope some action is taken regarding the blocked cubicles.

1,2023-06-29,"PureGym, you're letting your members down","reviewing for puregym as a whole, being a member that attends tottenham court road and marylebone. im fed up of the class changes, which have massively affected my fitness journey. marylebone started charging £4 for a particular step class, which plummeted overnight in attendees and eventually got cancelled. now the same is being applied to tottenham court road. as a result im looking elsewhere as the brand lacks care for quality and care for its members that seek a fitness routine thats guided by an instructor in the comfort of a class.  puregym instructor led classes lack enthusiasm and inspiration. most will lead a class without any involvement or even breaking a sweat; how inspiring!  in contrast, after trial and error across 3 puregym locations (swiss cottage, marylebone, tottenham court) private instructor lead classes (specifically aerobics/ step/ pilates) have instructors that give 110% effort every class.  its a shame to have already seen a favoured and fully booked class at marylebone go down the drain, to see another favoured class at tottenham court do the same. im fed up and currently trialling other gym brands, puregym youve let me and a lot of your members down."
5,2023-06-29,Fab gym great value for money,"the staff were extremely friendly and professional, as well as non judgemental and knowledgable, especially neil.  there is a wide selection of equipment which is laid out well, as well as cleaning stations to keep the equipment clean.  the gym temperature feels comfortable and the facilities are great; everything you need. do take a padlock for the lockers.  the price is very reasonable and there seems so be a great selection of classes for both full members and those on restricted hours. the membership can be ended without any fees which is very convenient and considerate given the current financial climate.  the parking facities make the gym easy to access and they offer an nhs discount.  great gym."

1,2023-06-28,PT Fat shaming,"fat-shaming in a place that should be used to promote self-confidence and positive body image is vile. i was recently made aware of an email sent out by one of puregyms ""personal trainers"" to his clients and shocked is an understatement. the ""pt"" in question used terms such as fat-slob in an attempt to motivate his clients to work harder to lose weight. fat phobic comments such as these is bullying and are perpetuating eating disorders (some of which have the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder). nobody with the immaturity and confidence to send out this email should be allowed to work in this industry. so many people spend months working up the confidence to walk into a gym and this email is just validation of their fears. i wont be naming and shaming this pt online because unlike this man, i dont believe that bullying is ever the solution. although, given how confidently he parades his ignorance with his clients (and all over his instagram account) im sure it wont be hard for the limehouse managers to guess who he is. im disgusted and i hope hes fired.

2,2023-06-04,Gym equipment is often broken down and…,"gym equipment is often broken down and connot be used. further to this poor hygene /bins overflowing. equipment is rarely wiped down by staff or users which is not not great. poor hygene generally. gym is often overcrowded with people queing to use weight resisitance machines. lack of windows makes the place feel dingy dim and soviet-era. some tv screens to watch sky news would be nice as lots of gyms had this 15-20 years ago. less intense lighting would be nice. whole place has a vaguely subterranean air due to lack of sunlight-like a gym on a mining colony on mars. also not impressed about cancelling 24 hour access to the gym with little or no communication. locker room now ""shuts""  or locks at 23:00 hours meaning realistically you cannot use the gym after 22:45 hours. am severly unimpressed by this as this was a major factor for joining. in addition to this gym staff few in number. realistically at this price point i understand that a pool is prehaps not an option but some kind of members area where people could meet/socialise /get a non-alcoholic drink would be nice. fitness first (now 24/7 fitness) had this 20 odd years ago with similar/smaller floorspace, cant see why it cant be done here."
5,2023-06-28,Great gym great staff,"very clean and tidy great staff and personal trainers, although bring a towel as very hot inside the gym when working out please install air con and wifi for the customers"
2,2023-06-28,Standards have slipped,"ive been going to this gym since it opened & for the most part its been fine, the staff are always polite & helpful if needed but recently the state of the building has very obviously fell below standards... the gym is currently closed for the 2nd day in a row because theres no running water... this has been an obvious inconvenience as i have no desire to travel to southgate or cheshunt during rush hour to go to either of those gyms. if it were convenient for me id be a member at cheshunt over enfield anyway as its a newer gym & also has free parking, its also cheaper (fr. £19.99 month) than enfield (fr £24.99 month). in addition to the most recent water issue, last weekend there were ""no hot water"" signs on the changing room doors, a few weekends ago there was a power cut that had half the gym in darkness for a while and there has been a big hole in the entrance hall of the mens changing rooms for ages. understandably machines will break & will be out of use from time to time, its a busy gym it should be expected but the general state of the building becoming run down & grotty, in my opinion is a reflection of a lack of investment in the buildings up keep from puregym. it needs a refurb & some money spent on it asap!"
1,2023-06-28,very poor relationship with car park operator,has a very poor relationship with their car park operator meaning that the free parking advertised as part of membership can easily cost as much as 6 months membership fees.  unfortunately they offer free parking but if you forget to enter registration in the computer the car park owner is not willing to honour the free parking and will not let you appeal it.  my parking alone has cost me £320 when it should be free. my annual membership is £240. it’s a shame the gym has such a poor relationship with the provider of services to its customers.  having joined the gym to improve my mental health this has in fact caused the opposite to happen.
3,2023-06-19,Poor hygiene,"poor hygiene, no sanitizer to clean equipment which is left dripping in sweat it is so of putting to use the equipment. it gets quite hot and stuffy air-conditioning should be turned up, broken equipment benches that wobble are a hazard which could lead to injury been reported to staff but nothing is done about it. changing rooms in particular toilet areas smell of urine had high hopes for this gym but standards have dropped dramatically will be looking for a new gym to join."

4,2023-06-19,Cannock Orbital,"cannock orbital  great gym, reasonably priced, lots of equipment selection. my only criticism is that its way too warm in an area that you are going to be warm as soon as you start exercising. for me personally i think the ambient temperature needs to drop 2 degrees. same with the water in the fountain, its way too warm to be refreshing."

2,2023-06-19,The gym needs a lot of TLC,"the gym needs a lot of tlc. new equipment would be great, and they could do with utilising the space better as theres too much room allocated to cardio machines that arent in use."
2,2023-06-20,Cleaning stations,i do not understand why this gym is removing their cleaning stations. it is basic hygiene to have these so i feel comfortable to train knowing i can clean before and after i use equipment. this is appalling does not make sense to remove these things.
3,2023-06-21,Good women's only area but we have no…,"good womens only area but we have no zenga water dispenser in our women only area so we have to go into the main exercise area to access the water - kind of defeats the object of having a women only area but no water access? 2nd negative is that the place flooded and closed but i had no email or update to tell me that it was closed until further notice perhaps because either was still a relatively new member? overall a friendly and relaxing atmosphere to train , people seem nice and staff approachable and helpful if asked questions"
1,2023-06-20,Issues with classes,"i love going to zumba and steps in london tottenham court road and i have been doing so for over a year now. with no warning from the gym and less than 2 week notice given to the amazing instructors, we are going to have to pay for our classes now (on top of the membership). i personally pay the full membership of £46 as i enjoy going to all these classes. from next week that is going to be an extra £32 on top of what i pay already. if this goes ahead i will no longer pay for my membership"

2,2023-06-16,Poor Hygiene - No working sinks for 4 weeks,majority of team really friendly. good selection of kit. main things to let gym down is cleanliness and tidiness. weights left all around the place especially when visiting early morning and nobody ever tidies up. cleanliness is generally poor with little/no sanitising spray and over flowing bins. to top it off there have been no working sinks in the men’s changing rooms for 4 weeks now and no sanitiser. the nearest sink to wash hands after using toilets is the single disabled toilets. pretty much sums up the lack of urgency and pride a lot of the team take (not all)
2,2023-06-20,Air-conditioning is not working and has…,"air-conditioning is not working and has not been for weeks now, and the machines are outdated and often broken. i emailed the gym and they didnt reply, and i note that on trust pilot they only reply to positive feedback."

2,2023-06-09,Not the best experience,"got a pair of glasses stolen from here. i understand it is not their responsibility if something is left outside locker, but it is not a bus station, and it is unlikely to happen in a quiet hour, so be careful what you leave outside lockers. overall, the equipment is not too bad.  edit:  like i stated above, i understand this is not staff responsibility, i just need to highlight that this was not the experience i had in other gym chains (such as virgin), in the exact scenario. i did try reaching out to the gym manager. however, he was not able to help, which i understand.  thanks for your response"
4,2023-06-19,Good first impressions.,"this was my first time at the sunderland gym (as a guest). i visited during an off peak period around 12:30 pm, so not too busy. the facilities were spacious, clean, & well ventilated. i got the impression the humidity might change for the worst once it got full as would the wait for machines? talking of machines, these were of a high quality although i was disappointed to discover there was only one leg extension machine in the whole building. on the other hand, i thought there were too many of the same machine for the same body part. will definitely bring my ear buds next time as i found myself being distracted by the noise from the cycle & aerobics classes. dont get me wrong, these are not criticisms, just observations. the overall vibe was excellent & the other users were really friendly. once i got used to the layout of the gym i thoroughly enjoyed my workout & i will definitely be going back."

4,2023-06-05,Good gym,"lots of equipment available, generally a great gym. can randomly flood at times and close for the day.  as more people adopt free weights the squat racks & spaces for deadlifting etc are really limited; the gym needs more of these or to expand.  in the middle of the day theres so many schoolkids going for a combination of flirting & newbie gainz, so choose your timing wisely! they come in herds."
5,2023-06-20,A new gym in Ballymena Hey!,"great new gym with lots of equipment and free weights. quiet during off peak times which suits me. helpful, friendly staff. changing rooms and showers a bit on the small side but kept clean. showers could be warmer and more powerful."

1,2023-06-20,Anyone with moral fortitude defected from this place,"no background check. applicants could just buy the course for access to vulnerable adults and fatherless girls, alongside a network of people who organised inside secret group chats- some mocked gym members and wrote positive reviews for themselves and their sect. viewable techniques also included humorous personas and cryptic threats of violence via stalking- to charm people with a smokescreen then deter them giving evidence."

1,2023-06-20,24/7?,"hi i would like to complain about kirkcaldy gym. i visited on yesterday at 16:30 and there was a sign on the door saying they were closed due to having no water. i spoke with a friend of mine who stays very close to the gym  later that night and his water came back on at 17:30 after the water board had carried out repairs. i decided i would visit in the morning instead, checked the app and it said the gym was open 24/7 so drove in again to find it still shut with the same signs up. that’s pretty poor service. can i have a refund please for the 2 days the gym was closed? i did get a message on monday after i had visited the gym telling me that my gym was closed and i could use the dunfermline gym  which is not really an option, but it was the reason i checked the app this morning!"

2,2023-06-17,Been told to stop my exercise,"i was using the gym since been open, but today i was asked by the member of staff while i was doing my workout on the bike to stop because they’ve got some classes 😀 it’s honestly a joke. i didn’t say anything and just leave the gym. even i have told him i’ve got only 2 min left and he was i need to start my classes. i was happy with the service especially to be open 24/7 due to my work. it’s going to be cancelled membership because no point to pay and even can’t do your workouts what you don’t understand. i have a training plan and on that day i had 45 min cycling. for this i picked your gym went there i started my exercise on the bike and just 2 min before to finish one of the staff came to me and asked me first how long i have got to finish, and i looked at my watch and said to him i’ve got only 2 min left to finish. and his reply was i am really sorry you need to stop because i need to start my classes. what of those my saying you don’t understand."
5,2023-06-17,Tyldesley is awesome,i’ve visited quite a few pure gyms on my travels and they all offer great services and equipment at a very agreeable price

5,2023-06-16,Pure Gym Bedford,pure gym at manton heights is a great gym to join. it is very good value for money and who doesn’t need that? the staff are fabulous too. i attend most of the gym classes which are always varied and can suit different tastes or interests. i like the fact some of the instructors change their routines and music often; increases enjoyment 100%
5,2023-06-16,Good value for money,"after redecoration reduced the friction between members. good and experience management improved fallowing of rules and regulations by members and made our gym very pleasant gym again. now, it feels safe to train in the bayswater gym without worrying."
4,2023-06-14,Good - but where’s the air con???,been a member since it opened and generally really happy. love the cycle classes with andy hopkins and lewis pook. but why is the air con so poor? it is barely noticeable throughout the gym but virtually non-existent in the cycle area. surely this can be addressed quickly and easily??
4,2023-06-16,Overall very good,"overall very good, i had to wait for equipment at times but that was probably a busy time of the day. i noticed quite a few young members using way too much weight than they could manage and not really knowing how to perform the exercise correctly which is always a recipe for injury. maybe it would be a good idea for the staff to be a little more vigilant."
1,2023-06-16,I was in London and wanted to use one…,"i was in london and wanted to use one of the pure gyms in london so i went on the app to try to see if i was able to use that gym if i upgraded to a plus account. because i wasn’t upgraded to a plus account, it wouldn’t tell me if i could use that gym if i subscribed. all it was telling me was i could only use the gym i’m registered to. i don’t even understand why you can’t use some pure gyms if you’re a plus member. it defeats the purpose and makes it pointless. the gyms you can use are very limited. the whole point of it should be to allow you to use any pure gym you come across if you’re not near the one you’re registered to. i might be mistaken but i think that’s how it used to be, now they limit which gyms you can use making it not worth paying for.  anyway so i upgraded to a plus account and i tried to find the gym i wanted to use and found out it wasn’t on the list, so now they’re saying i’ll be charged an extra £6 on my next bill for the plus membership, even though i didn’t actually benefit from it. i won’t be paying it and i’m cancelling my membership."
1,2023-06-16,PureShyte,"website said 24/7 i asked on posts and was assured it’s open 24/7, went for a workout slightly before midnight and put my stuff (house keys - motorbike keys - motorbike helmet - clothes - wallet etc in changing area, finished workout after 12 and went to get my gear & shower only to find doors all locked & was unable to get my personal stuff, vehicle & house keys & wallet all locked in. i had to walk home with no means of paying for a taxi nor being able to ring a taxi as my stuff was locked in the building. i had to climb in windows late on to get in my house. total shambles & still not received an apology - equipment is crap as well, treadmills are crap that don’t even hold a water bottle, weights slip out of your hands and it’s small. don’t waste your time here go on down the dual carriageway a mile to a proper gym (lifestyle)"
5,2023-06-07,Great management team,"i go to this great gym every day. its a very equipped gym, and its great in terms of cleanness too. the staff is also amazing. theyre respectful, helpful, friendly, and professional. recently, some of the water pipes on the ceiling on the ground floor suddenly burst and the water took over the floor. i was there when it happened and when i saw that, i thought to myself; ""oh damn! its gonna take at least a week to fix that and the gym will be close during repair"". well, i was wrong!  not only, the management team repaired it without closing the gym, but they also fixed it in less than a week while having all safety measurements in place. i want the management to know that i, on behalf of every gym rat who goes to this gym every day, really appreciate their great job and support. well done, and thank you very much!"
4,2023-06-16,Decent gym,decent gym. enough equipment but i didn’t go in peak time. everything is clean and new and there’s not loads of parking but there’s a massive tesco across the road and it’s a few extra steps. didn’t feel like there was any air con on though was warm but quite happy with it
1,2023-06-15,Gym is in crisis!,"where do i start…. i have been a member of this gym for  a number of years now and i have seen a huge decline with how the gym is run and managed. the gym facilities, air conditioning, equipment and parking  has hit it’s all time lowest point and it appears to me that  this gym is being run into the ground. the only good thing about the gym is the space to train but there are now so many problems which have not been fixed or dealt with over the years that the issues can not be overlooked anymore.  when speaking to management about the issues it’s never ending excuses with issues not being fixed or dealt with properly.  it’s only going to get worse which is completely unacceptable with the amount of money they are making from memberships each month. despite the issues and members complaints they actually had the audacity to increase the gym membership 4 months to ago to help “towards the gym maintenance”, no improvements have been made in this time and it’s got significantly worse. below is a small snapshot of the issues  .. •the air conditioning in the gym has again stopped working as soon as the hot weather arrives, this is the third year in a row this has happened. the mangers that have come and gone in this time all make the same excuses and say they are working on it and air conditioning unit uses a smart system which isnt so smart! its unbearable to train with the heat, not pleasant breathing in everyone’s germs and body odours, sweating like your in a sauna and generally not a nice environment to be in. i felt like i was going to pass out the other day, at least last year they left all the doors open and they hired large portable aircon units. i’ve had to start training at other gyms because of  this which i shouldn’t have to do when i’m paying for this membership. • the gym equipment is now old and tired and needs replacing ( like the new precor equipment they have down south) things are always broken with out of order signs on, most of  the cable machines are tired  and on there way out, dumbbells and olympic bars are mostly bent, some cardio machines are broken and need serious maintenance. a serious injury will occur, it’s just waiting to happen! •cleaning facilities to wipe equipment down has been reduced  since january therefore equipment is not as clean as it should be. it might be the time of day i train but i personally have never seen a member of staff cleaning the equipment and also changing rooms have a disgusting smell constantly.•the gym did not notify members that 3 months ago there would be building work commencing in the apartments across the road and that the building company would be using upto 20 car park spaces and their builders allowed to park in it too. parking is difficult for members best of times and not enough spaces for the gym capacity before this. parking is at a premium and you cannot park in any of the surrounding streets as they are all double yellow lines. we don’t know when it will finish. on many occasions i and other members have had to train at other gyms when it is busy after 5pm because we can’t find a parking space. •most  of the pt’s are  unfriendly and not welcoming unless you’re part of their “clique”•the new assistant manager needs to address the issues raised by not only myself, but many other members too instead of parading around the gym gawping at myself and other male members.  i find it really uncomfortable and actually hypocritical given they promote “a no harassment”  campaign on posters all over the gym. check the cctv, you can clearly see him checking individuals out. •the gym is listed on a gay dating/meet up site which members can use the facilities late at night to get up to alsorts. its been highly rated aswell believe it or not.. madness! it’s not what we signed up to. the list is endless and no matter which manager takes over or managers from head office, none appear to be doing anything about it.unless something changes drastically, which i don’t think it will, there will be a mass exodus where members will leave and not come back. you shouldn’t be charged nearly £30 a month to be train in substandard facilities where management don’t listen to or address any issues raised. if you are thinking of joining this gym, do yourself a favour and find another one."
4,2023-06-15,Great atmosphere,"great atmosphere, clean, members of staff always available, only gripe i have are the showers in the mens, a few are out of order and a couple more dont drain properly,  so you are standing g in dirty water, and who knows what floats out of the plughole."
5,2023-06-15,Honest account of my experience so far.,"having just joined this gym, so far i’m finding it very relaxing and it’s helping me grow in confidence. i can already see i’m starting to achieve my desired body shape, the equipment is easy to use and atmosphere very chilled."
2,2023-06-02,Poor Cleanliness,the changing rooms are ridiculously dirty and the gym floor looks like it never gets cleaned! does the gym have a cleaning regime that the staff are not following or does it need to employ new cleaners? this does not leave a very good impressions whilst working out and deters me from coming back
2,2023-06-16,Gyms too hot. No AC. Smell.,"whilst the gyms have good equipment, they never turn ac on. it’s their policy. it means the gym is so hot in summer and smells awful. this is a company-wide policy. also customer service centrally is absolutely awful. i think they may be bots!"
5,2023-06-15,Big and nice,"big gym, not too crowded, so the equipments are enough to cater for all. location is also good."
2,2023-06-16,Nice big gym with plenty of equipment…,"nice big gym with plenty of equipment but the toilets are always in a disgusting state, if a piece of equipment breaks it seems to stay broken for weeks on end and flavoured water dispenser only seems to dispense stagnant filth. this isn’t based off of one visit as i use this gym regularly."
4,2023-06-15,Great atmosphere,great atmosphere. lots of equipment available and classes are great. most of all good value for money.
4,2023-06-15,I rated the gym 4 stars for the PTs,"i rated the gym 4 stars for the pts. i am not going to name them individually, but a big accolade to them all.  i have been visiting the gym for a few years, and all of them are doing a fantastic job despite what is now an obvious issue, the management. one can only feel sorry for those hard-working professionals who go to work every day in what has become an environment with an atmosphere.  everybody seems to be talking about the management 🤔 🙄. the few interactions i had myself were , i have to say, not the most pleasant.  i am also surprised to see a gym managed with the top management never seen teaching a class . that tells me that they cant!"
2,2023-06-15,It’s 30° outside and the air…,it’s 30° outside and the air conditioner is not working! it’s totally too hot for workout. i almost fainted because of no fresh air i also spoke with other members and everything coming because of it  air conditioning it’s not working since few weeks

5,2023-06-15,Training with Greg,i attend the gym twice a week for a session with my personal trainer greg he is most supportive and attentive to my exercise needs. he thinks about how to use exercise to benefit my every day life and researches to give the best advice.
1,2023-06-02,Please get a grip on your staff!!!,"i canceled my gym membership after a few months due to various reasons, primarily because of a staff member (edit: management at pure gym reported my review for identifying the staff member by name so i have omitted it from the review. however she has been mentioned in other reviews here and on google). she acts like she owns the gym, regularly forcing members, including myself, out of the weights section for her private class. she also records these classes for her social media which picks up other members in the background who probably don’t want to be in the video (i know i certainly don’t want to be an extra in the background of her boxercise vids). despite the availability of a private room, she insists on disrupting our workouts.  this is not the first time ive witnessed her rude behavior. when a member asked for help with a malfunctioning machine, she responded with a sour face as if she was being inconvenienced even though its her literal job.  additionally, she frequently shouts and uses foul language. other reviews also mention similar experiences with her. while the rest of the staff is friendly and the renovated womens section is great, the gym is often overcrowded, and my overall experience is consistently ruined by this staff member. considering the price increase and my dissatisfaction, i have decided to switch to thegym despite the longer journey.  edit: i’m not entirely sure why pure gym management have asked me to update my review. unless they have addressed the issue of the member who created a hostile environment, there is no reason for me to make any changes. simply stating that theres no tolerance for that behaviour make no difference to me or other members at the gym🥴"

1,2023-06-15,Dysfunctional Management,"im fed up with the manager at muswell hill. she has driven all the wonderful trainers away through bullying and unreasonable behaviour. she has also created an unpleasant environment in the gym for customers.  after we lost one particular trainer, 10 former muswell hill gym users (myself included) moved to do the class at another gym.  does puregym not monitor its terrible staff turnover? its a serious problem. every time a trainer leaves, all their classes are cancelled or taken over by less experienced staff. we dont want to have to reschedule work and child care commitments every few weeks just because the manager has another problem with another member of staff.  puregym, you are losing fantastic staff and clients at a really alarming rate. please look into this."

3,2023-06-12,Typical PureGym experience,"typical puregym experience, no bench press, only 2 squat racks which double up for bench meaning constantly waiting around, no power rack and too small to do cleans and deadlifts safely. but of course there are 40 unused treadmills, plenty of unused exercise bikes, a spin area even though there is a large empty area for classes. if you’re even semi serious about weightlifting, find another gym"

5,2023-06-12,It's fantastic,"its fantastic—clean, easy to use, and reasonable membership. their app is excellent and provides you with all that you need to know. you will feel confident from day one"
3,2023-06-11,A Few Issues,pure gym meadowhall is ok apart from a couple of issues. the yanga sports water machine is allegedly set to dispense 200ml every 20 minutes. this is far from the unlimited water it advertises on their website. the website also talks about dehydration affecting performance. 200ml every 20 minutes will not address that. the other thing is one member of staff working on a saturday morning and also expected to teach a class. that is quite frankly absurd. they need to address the sports water issue and the staffing. the sports water issue appears to also contravene the consumer rights act as it is not as described.
3,2023-06-12,Good gym dreadful showers,"the gym itself is fine and just got new weights. however the mens showers are disgusting. there is a horrible smell coming from the drains. today, it suddenly got worse and i literally had to jump out the shower because it made me gag.  you really need to sort out the showers as they are utterly disgusting."

5,2023-06-12,Great classes!,"we have followed different classes with almost every trainer, we liked it very much! we have been very satisfied with the attention and enthusiasm of the trainers teaching the groups. they have attention for technique and proper execution of the exercises and drive you to go beyond."

1,2023-06-12,What sick animal charges to find out your weight??,"who the hell charges to weigh yourself? sorry but i find it absolutely inexplicably disgusting that people who pay for a gym service can’t even have an access to a scale. it’s a total total disgrace to charge 70p for someone to weigh themselves, honestly i’m surprised there’s no uproar from this but i guess people are there mainly to lift weights not complain."

3,2023-06-11,Pathetic air conditioning!,great gym let down by pathetic air conditioning!
3,2023-06-10,No air-con for over 12 months,"i’ve been going to this gym for a couple of years now and whilst over it’s a great gym, there is a problem with the air-con and has been for over a year. last year it was said it was being fixed so you would expect it to be sorted by now. its not really been a problem over the past few months but it feels like a sauna this time of year and it’s ridiculously uncomfortable. either the air-con hasn’t been fixed or they are trying to cut costs. i feel that air-con facilities are a basic necessity in a gym and it’s a shame they don’t recognise this."
5,2023-06-04,This gym has a very relaxed atmosphere…,this gym has a very relaxed atmosphere but also the staff are always happy to assist when needed the one and only down side is the air con could be used more especially in the hot weather we have been experiencing but overall a really great gym.
1,2023-06-10,This is the worst gym ever,this is the worst gym ever. to be specific the one in chester has a very low standard. hygiene wise 0. maintenance is -10. one of the leg press has been broken for over 5 months now. gym equipments are very rusty. some of the bars are so bad that you wonder if they have recycling value. you even lucky if you use the toilet and the hand dryer comes on.
3,2023-06-04,Consider other gyms,"it seems i am very unlucky, but whenever i use my local puregym the equipment is faulty, i get regular notifications that the toilets are out of order, or something has failed blah blah. the one i go to has a small car park, and there are often waits to get a space. i generally get early enough but there have been incidents of people arguing over the space i am leaving. my particular gym feels over subscribed as there is an average 150 people in when i attend. before covid struck the gym had builders in and there was dust everywhere but they carried on despite complaints and concerns of what we were all inhaling, i really dont know why i renewed after covid, its a pretty dismal experience."
2,2023-06-11,Lack of air con killing this great gym,"this has always been my favourite gym (5 stars for sure) but it’s just way too hot in there now. i only weight lift and it’s killing my progress, can’t imagine how the cardio gymmers feel. such a shame because it really does have all the equipment and a great atmosphere."

3,2023-06-10,Locker room and shower,i have to write this because it annoys me.  since i have a 24h membership gym then why are the cloakroom plus showers closed from  00:00 to 3:00?  please change it and leave it open for use.  i would like to use the gym before work and use the shower and locker room after exercise.  it is ridiculous to close the locker room with the shower!

1,2023-06-09,"zero customer service, over-crowding, broken equipment, non-hygenic",zero customer service. no one reply immediately or reply not helpful at all. out of service signs on equipments broken for weeks and weeks. poor hygiene in changing room and clogged drain in shower. over crowding during peak hours and too much waitng time to use equipment. app is slow and buggy. bring your own cleaning liquid and tissue as gym doesnt provide it and you see other people sweat sticking on the benches. gym says cleaning wipes were only for covid. as if after covid people stops sweating and totally fine to use gross sweaty benches with others.

5,2023-06-10,A lovely Pilates class,love these pilates classes. having been away from any form of training for quite some time it was a big step coming back to do a class. francoise is very inspiring and motivating in the way she chats through every bit of good that we are doing to our bodies and minds all the way through the sessions. friendly but not overly chatty or clicky like some instructors at places i’ve been previously. very professional. love it.

2,2023-05-29,I booked a class on Tuesday 30.05.2023…,i booked a class on tuesday 30.05.2023 for 7pm lbt and was the only person there. no one came to take the class. i waited and no one came to ask if i was there for the class. when i realised no one was coming i left the room and told the instructor who was leaving a spin class. i had been coming fir 2 years before. i left due to an illness and had rejoined paying a booking fee in may 2023. this would have been my first class on returning that i was looking forward to. not happy about this when giffnock is cheaper andmy friend and i  thinking of going  there for service i would expect at any pure gym.
2,2023-06-09,Would not recommend,"i just started this week. had zumba, bodyfit and dance so far. zumba was fine (ok types, i have done more active zumba at another gym in west hampstead). bodyfit was also ok but dance was just weird. first 15 mins we did 2 songs in good active dance movements and just as i was beginning to sweat and burn fat, the instructor started showing us some moves on the mat (like pilates or yoga) and she spent so much time trying to explain us the moves that my body completely cooled down. the rest of the 30 mins was just her showing us steps, we trying to learn and then doing it. but im sure i didnt burn a single calorie. it would be good to have a dance class which claims to burn over 250 cals do just that and not bother with teaching us some spiderman moves! also the smell of sweat is way too overpowering and general cleanliness is clearly lacking, but so many people have said the same thing in the reviews and if nothing has happened so far, maybe itll stay this way. my goal is to lose weight and gain some core strength so i will be continuing but not as happily as my experience with studio society at west hampstead."
3,2023-06-04,i feel the gym is a nice place,"i feel the gym is a nice place, staff are to them selves and i think only a couple of individuals could be more caring, ie smiling etc as most are very good hence my whole family are with pure gym , overall its a good athmosphere there ."

3,2023-06-04,Hit and Miss but OK,"my pt is the best thing about the place.  i have frequented pure gym on and off since this location opened approximately 12 years ago.  at present, the toilets and showers are frequently broken.  a lot of the cardio equipment is also broken and much of the fixed weight equipment is unbelievably dirty.  it used to be much much better, but it seems present salaried staff either dont have time or dont care about the gyms presentation or cleanliness.  the entrance also smells of urine, so either an animal or a person has got in at some point, but this doesnt seem to be getting sorted out.  overall it has a decent range of equipment, the opening hours and location are convenient and there are also some fabulous pts available.  however, it needs some tlc to get any more stars than 3 for me."

1,2023-06-04,Direct Debit,i am not happy because you guys said you will take money from my account t of £30.99 with an additional £5 charge which i was ok with since i was struggling to do the payment myself and now i am being told i am getting charged £50.99. i had that money ready for you guys to take out and you didn’t take it out. please can you cancel my membership because i do not know what is going on anymore. i will start gym somewhere else because this is irritating. i just want to become healthy
1,2023-06-04,No Trainers,"booked on 2 inductions, no trainer turned up either time, when finally found an account for customer service, they pushed me to one account to another, with no one responding to my issue. expensive when not getting any service"
3,2023-06-04,I like the opening hours and the range…,"i like the opening hours and the range of equipment. however, the variety of classes that are available at the times that i am able to attend is limited and i fear getting bored and with not attending any. it would be nice if there were more options, not only for the choice but also the social element.  it is always clean and tidy, and the staff are friendly and helpful."

3,2023-06-04,"A basic, no frills added gym group","a basic, no frills gym, as reflected in the monthly fee of less than £25.  no thoughts given to a varied age demographic in terms of classes on offer - same as so many others in offering generic classes where theres an assumed level of fitness, age and capability.  equipment same as so many other gyms - nothing new or exciting!  no staff on duty for much of the weekend, with few or no classes run on sundays."
1,2023-06-09,Joined recently and in the last 2…,"joined recently and in the last 2 months i’ve been insulted 3 times by an instructor who thinks being rude, aggressive and insulting is considered ‘sarcasm’.  first off, it’s unprofessional and secondly, i don’t know you well enough to endure your idea of sarcasm. i am seriously considering leaving because of that one person. i’ve never had a pleasant exchange with them no matter how i try. they are quite pleasant to everyone else but to me and another gym member who is my friend, they are quite rude and it’s completely unnecessary and unacceptable.  i did not spend my money to get in shape only to be insulted by my instructor for asking a simple question to which a simple yes or no answer would have sufficed.  its making my gym experience very uncomfortable and unpleasant. life is stressful enough, i don’t need this added stress at a place i pay for to help me get rid of stress."

1,2023-06-05,Cancellation policy is ableist,"puregym’s class cancellation policy (cancel up to 4 hours before the class starts, 3 late cancellations within a month and you lose the right to book classes) is ableist and inaccessible. ironic as marketing is always putting out ‘be your authentic self’ and ‘our gyms are for everyone’ messages.  some disabilities, parental and carer responsibilities, mental health conditions - and just if you had booked an early morning class and woke up feeling ill - are all reasons why the 4 hour window is too large and disproportionately affects groups that already face challenges.  speaking from a place of lived experience, i don’t think puregym is as inclusive as it brands itself as and i’d encourage it to look at its cancellation policy with someone who can advise on diversity, inclusion and equity.  puregym: you’re alienating a very large proportion of your customers and it adds insult to injury that your marketing messages don’t align. do better."

2,2023-06-04,I enjoy using your services hence why I…,i enjoy using your services hence why i pay every month. i am paying extra so i am able to use the rehydration machine which isn’t working properly. i used this machine up to 6 times on my visit yesterday and tried different flavours yet none of them worked. i am particularly annoyed because i pay extra every single month for this service also several of the machines are out of order and at times is out of order for over a month. i can’t fathom how your able to charge me every month for your services that are not up to par or align with what i signed up for in the first place i would like some sort of resolution somewhere to compensate for the loss of funds paying for a service that isn’t full filled

2,2023-06-01,Visited Castle Marina Gym in Nottingham…,"visited castle marina gym in nottingham this is not my local gym but close and they have a great functional fitness area that is great for my hyrox training. i’d landed to do some specific training on the sled and track, so had positioned myself on one side of the track and started stretching off. there was a fitness class on at 5:30 which only had 6 people in it and the fitness instructor used one of the 2 sleds they have available and then as i went back to bag to retrieve my water bottle she took the other sled, i politely went over and said that i was just about to use it and was rudely shut down and informed the fitness class took all priority over everything else? the most annoying part was that both sleds had the same weight on and for half the workout only one sled was used, so i waited patiently and gave some feedback at the end. but as expected i got the same line about classes taking priority, they couldn’t grasp the fact that they could have still done their class using one sled therefore allowing me to workout using the other sled."

1,2023-06-04,Machines are always broke,"machines are always broke. and not exaggerating, they stay broke for months. the one i use, bentley bridge wolverhampton, doesn’t really have many machines, so when a machine is broken, you really notice it."

3,2023-06-04,There is limited space in pure gym…,"there is limited space in pure gym brislington, the upstairs is badly mapped out and therefore does not allow much space for activities. as well as this, the leg press has been out of order for the last 3 months, and they only have one of these so it is unacceptable for it to be out of order for this long, with no clear indication of when this will be fixed (if it is even going to be fixed) apart from the lack of space and broken equipment, the rest of the gym is great :)"

5,2023-06-04,A month into my membership and really…,"a month into my membership and really pleased. the class timetable was a big priority for me and it does not disappoint! i can easily view the classes for all branches near to me, meaning theres always a class available to suit my schedule. legs, bums and tums has been a great class run by multiple different instructors and a great workout each time. pump is another class which was really well run and allows the opportunity to use a small range of equipment with support and guidance. trainers are all friendly and knowledgable on each encounter. the gym itself is well equipped, clean and well air conditioned on each visit. changing rooms are spacious, clean and an easy place to get ready if visiting before work for example. the app works seamlessly for gym access but has so much more useful information from specific instructions for machine usage, suggested workouts for specific body parts, overall workout suggestions, at home workouts and lots more. video previews give an idea of class contents before you book in and are clear on the name of the trainer and the location of the class at the gym. overall, an amazing gym and incredible value for money."
3,2023-06-04,Clean and well maintained,staff are always friendly. the gym is clean and well maintained. plenty of treadmills so you can always get one even when it’s busy the gym is small and often so busy it’s hard to get on the weights equipment you want and almost impossible during peak time

4,2023-06-04,Value For Money Gym,"overall its good gym which has most of the machine and dedicated area for each type training i.e. strength, cardio, weightlifting etc.  few things that may be better are, there is not a person which you can ask something, you should hire a personal trainer and even a scale machine is not there."
4,2023-06-04,The gym was clean and not over busy,"the gym was clean and not over busy, i can go anytime up til 4pm and didnt have to wait for equipment.  it had a friendly vibe and i didnt feel awkward as im 54 and just starting my fitness journey so not the most energetic yet ! i would recommend,"
3,2023-06-04,it's very disappointing experience due…,its very disappointing experience due to the fact that there are two machines (cross trainers ) they are more popular than the treadmills and one cross trainer  has been out of order for the last two weeks so having to que up for the one is ridiculous and very frustrating also i pay for the extra benefit of the juice machine and there is not one there. on a plus tge gym is always clean
1,2023-04-30,Don’t go there,"management is horrible, 50% of machines don’t work, water has been broken on and off for months, it is getting more and more packed but the care put in the gym goes down. there is a reason i left. ac is also broken most times. hot and cold in random areas. horrible. have been going there for 3 years and it’s the worst it’s ever been. you give feedback directly you get a ‘thank you for feedback we aim to improve’ eff that. you didn’t improve anything. do better."

5,2023-06-06,The instructors of the classes are fab!,"the instructors of the classes are great ! very friendly! aleksandra, anthony and sophie are all fab and even though the classes are quiet in the morning when i go , they are always enthusiastic!

3,2023-06-04,The equipment is excellent,"the equipment is excellent, but the only down side is the volume of members throughout the day. most days you are constantly above 100 which primarily use the weights, benches and gym equipment. most cardio machines stand idol. i tried to train twice in 1 day and left within 15 minutes due to no equipment available"
5,2023-06-04,Excellent Gym,i feel comfortable in the gym and am able to work out in a way that suits me.  the app is excellent with training programmes and ideas! good variety and flexible membership to suit everyone.
4,2023-06-04,"Great gym, not great showers","pros this is an affordable, accessible gym, clean and convenient. the machines are new and there is a good choice. the studio is adequate and there is a good variety of classes. good value for money overall and pleasant, welcoming environment. great stretch classes. good selection of modern cardio machines, there are always free steppers and treadmills. cons the drawbacks are that, with it being no frills, the showers really arent great. changing room is ok and lockers numerous, spacious and clean, but there is only one individual changing cubicle and the showers temperature is just about the right side of warm for my liking, it is on a fixed setting so cannot be adjusted, pressure is poor and worst of all it is extremely brief- have to keep pressing the button. washing your hair is a real feat. no reachable hooks to hang clothes inside shower. overall a slight, inexpensive improvement in the showers could make all the difference. in addition there could be more machines for legs - leg abductors and leg presses are sometimes hogged in between sets. just my experience."
5,2023-06-04,Great gym,"plenty of weights and machines to use, never had to wait for any of the cardio machines even at peak time"

4,2023-06-04,Its not really 'you',"its not really you - l think the gym runs itself. naturally there are some classes - the personal there are friendly enough. my rating is purely based on the equipment there. i only have limited time and a limited period in which l can go. much of the equipment l want to use is busy and unavailable which is good for you - not so good for users like me. still for the monthly fee, l think its value. close to me and open anytime l can make it."
5,2023-06-04,Excellent classes at convenient times…,"excellent classes at convenient times for working people, and 30-45 min allows me to get in and out before work. most coaches are very motivating. would be good to have the odd person around to ask how to use a machine."
2,2023-06-04,The gym is frequently overcrowded,"the gym is frequently overcrowded, and there are insufficient machines, resulting in long wait times of 12–20 minutes per machine. the odor can also be quite unpleasant. however, the affordability of the gym is a positive aspect, although it can be difficult to secure a turn."

2,2023-06-04,There is a delay from those who play…,"there is a delay from those who play the iron devices, as there is only one device from each device, and the devices are not integrated, knowing that the space available for the pedestrian and bicycle belt is a large area that must be exploited and the place arranged more."
5,2023-06-04,6 weeks in and no complaints,"i’ve really enjoyed my time so far. i got back into gym after a serious health scare, and decided to pay for a pt to help me along the way. to date (6 weeks in) i’m 1 and a half stone down, getting stronger, and much more confident. yes it can get busy at points, but so can every gym at prime time. just gotta be patient and kind, wait your turn for equipment, and respect each other. so excited for the new changes too (women’s only area!)"

2,2023-06-04,Belfast st Anne’s square gym,"belfast st anne’s square gym. overall average. the equipment is ok and the gym is big and spans two floors.  the flavoured water dispenser has been broken for nearly a week despite the gym well knowing about the issue. some people are paying extra for that and this should be fixed asap. the ventilation system is poor and the air con has been broken for months downstairs and it gets really warm in the summer, unacceptable. only one hygiene station per floor, absolutely not enough. they have removed some of them, nobody knows why, making it even more unlikely that people will clean the machines after themselves. the place could do with some improvement."
4,2023-06-04,Very good facilities and excellent…,very good facilities and excellent staff. just two comments:  one of the rowing machines is too close to the weightlifting machine - there is a risk here if someone falls off the latter.  why is there now only one cleaning station?

4,2023-06-04,Good Gym,"a good, clean well stocked gym. plenty of free weights and a good selection of resistance machines. also the gym has a good atmosphere. my only complaint is that there is a leg press machine that has been out of order for weeks, although this isn’t a major issue."

2,2023-06-06,Some major issues need to be addressed,"the gym is totally fine when not too busy (e.g. weekend afternoons or late mornings), but due to its proximity to schools/college, its often flooded with groups of teenagers who dont respect basic rules like putting the weights back or cleaning equipment after their use. the lack of hygiene of these young gym goers is something that should be addressed by the staff as well. also, they tend to be glued to certain machines without actually doing anything (they are just chatting, laughing and playing games on their phones). the worst issue however is that many of them are underage (some look 11-12) which is against the gyms own rules (please see membership t&cs) and they clearly shouldnt be in this space. the workers dont seem to be bothered with this issue, but this is a serious safeguarding problem and may also invalidate the business insurance in case any injury is caused to (or by) these kids. i hope this feedback is taken seriously and some real actions will be taken to observe the gyms own rules by its workers and prevent underage kids from joining/attending the gym."
5,2023-06-07,Review on PT sessions with Fraser…,review on pt sessions with fraser sandiford.  for many years i have suffered with lower back and pelvis pain i have visited many physios and chiropractors over the years. after a recent fall i caused damage that i thought would take me months to heal from. i contacted fraser on the hope he would be able to guide me with a few exercises that would help elevate the daily discomfort.  in our first session fraser took on board my anxiety with being in a busy gym and adapted our sessions to ensure i was comfortable and happy.  i am now going into my 3rd month with the pt sessions and cant fault anything. he is always pushing me to get that pb and there when i feel i need assistance.  since having my sessions i no longer go to the chiropractor and have noticed the difference in my posture and physique. without fraser i wouldnt be pain free so a massive thank you.
1,2023-06-07,Really disappointed with customer…,"really disappointed with customer service and lack of care when i’ve needed support. i’ve been with pure gym 3 years and the moving gym process has consistently been difficult. i’ve moved 3 times in this period. a task you would think would be simple to relocate gyms. i have been charged twice for starting new gyms and wasted days in transition both times without a gym to train in. this time i’ve wasted literally hours online trying to move gyms to be passed to another app. really poor experience. the gyms themselves are mostly fine, lacking in clean wash facilities in all 3 facilities i’ve used. i stopped using them early on. looking to the future i need a gym i can rely on. especially as moving house is stressful enough to then be stuck without a gym for days on end waiting for algorithm computer programs to help you."

1,2023-06-07,Understaffed and no manager found.,"i find that the gym is very understaffed, especially when trying to contact a manager about my membership, every time i have been in, no manager is in and have been told there’s only one, so when i try and come in at alternative times ,they are never there. classes are also bad and cancelled a lot, i’ve been a member for over 2 years and the past few months it has gone downhill. i used to come with a friend, but they cancelled their membership due to this. i’m thinking of doing the same. needs more staff and classes which aren’t cancelled"

5,2023-06-06,Fantastic equipment and budget friendly.,"a fantastic gym, with space and equipment catering to all fitness styles and sports while keeping the membership budget friendly and affordable. gym chains or leisure centres usually fall into the trap of having an unnecessary amount of cardio machines and not much else, but the heanor puregym branch has a fully functional rig complete with lifting platforms, a sizeable functional fitness space with all the necessary equipment, and a good variety of machine equipment and bodybuilding benches. the lifting platforms are a great asset, given that commercial gyms very rarely cater for this. all in all, whatever style of fitness youre into, puregym heanor can accommodate. my only small complaint is the heating system is on an automatic timer, and having the heating come on in june whilst halfway through a metcon is not the one!"

3,2023-06-04,Zero Politeness,the gym in general is well equipped and worth the monthly fee against the other big branded gyms or small business owed ones. having said that the amount of personal trainers is huge and yet not one can raise a smile and be polite other than to the people they know through classes or if they engage with them. i am not sure why but never feel welcome by any of the staff please can some training be done to be positive to all customers not just the ones you like the look off.

4,2023-06-04,Amazing functional area,love all the equipment in the functional area. it gives me such a varied workout each time. i would give a 5 star but it is a shame there’s not another space for classes to train. as they’re always in the area when i’m there so i can’t always get the best use of the space.

2,2023-06-04,- Luke warm at best and often cold…,"- luke warm at best and often cold showers (they have said this is a national change to lower the temperature of them to save costs). - often grotty shower and changing areas, the changing area in this specific gym is small so it gets dirty quickly if not maintained. - equipment is recently starting to break and a few items are begining to show their age. - for large parts of the year this year only one working toilet and the hand dryer didnt work. it was replaced with paper towel and then people began to throw these everywhere, not the gyms fault but because not cleaned well often left the changing rooms in a mess. the issue doesnt occur if the hand dryer wasnt broken for long periods. - the big plus is helpful and friendly staff.  i used to love this gym, i have been a member for 18 months but this year i decided to move after the cold showers after a long gym session was the final straw!"

4,2023-06-05,Quite Happy but two tiny suggestions…,"i am happy with almost everything but two suggestions: 1. it might be very good to have water/detox water machine even small size water cooler device in each floor. sometimes i am in the third floor and in the middle of a workout and my water gets finished but going three levels down doesn’t seem good as it fully interrupts the exercise but if we had such machine in all floors i could get it rapidly and be back to the exercise. 2. still the tissues are not sufficient. yesterday i came to the ground floor and took tissue and came back to third floor to sanitise the device. an extra or two of the tissue rolls is really necessary otherwise the hygienic standards will not be good and members might have to remain the devices uncleaned and not-sterilised for the next person. generally the gym is great, clean and with friendly staff. the devices are sufficient and the ventilation is really brilliant. i recommend it strongly to everyone as i think it is a very nice and professional gym with high standards."
1,2023-06-04,Don’t recommend this gym,"app is a joke. customer service is even worse.  not using air con during hot days is another joke and the timings of classed, really!! all the good classes are scheduled during working hours and other than that they are 16:45 or 17:00. crazy given most people work til 5-5:30. i have just cancelled due to constant issues, however, i would have left sooner if it werent for steph and brandon!!"

3,2023-06-05,"Why are cleaning/sanitise stations being removed? Covid aside, it’s good practice to spray and wipe before and after use","i enjoy going to puregym, but it would be nice to see the company make more of an effort in terms of hygiene. the cleaning stations at 2 of the branches i go to have been removed and the staff said they were removed as covid has gotten better overall. a gym representative told me i could bring my own towel to wipe down the machines before and after use, but that just simply wipes sweat around, doesn’t sanitise anything.  i see that point, but i don’t think people were cleaning off the machines before and after use solely due to covid, but more so to sanitise the machines and equipment from other peoples sweat and germs in general. gyms promote health and well-being, why wouldn’t they want to encourage customers to keep the equipment clean and sanitised?"

1,2023-06-04,Disgusting male showers. I can't believe nobody has complained about this yet.,"this is a message i tried to send privately -via email, private message on social media, etc. but you dont make it easy: no contact emails, phones and use chatbots on social media. i had no luck getting to a real person so ill copy it all here.  hi, i have been wanting to write for a few weeks now regarding the state of the male showers in some of your gyms. i have been a member for over a decade and used to visit one or more of your gyms in edinburgh almost daily. to me these were exceptional, well priced and always clean.  well, after a long break during the pandemic years i have started training again -mostly in edinburgh west gym but also in the one in dunfermline, and have to say the state of the shower facilities is really something... i have thought many times about taking some photos or a video and posting it all to social media but i dont like to be the creep with a phone out in the changing rooms and prefer to give you the chance to rectify this.  just to make it clear, the male showers in edinburgh west are not being properly (or at all?) cleaned -they have orange stains (accumulated dirt) all over the place, shower drains that were partially blocked by fluff and stuff weeks ago still as they were. this is the case no matter what time (early morning, afternoon, late at night) i visit. every single time i find myself looking for a shower that would not instantly give me some kind of fungal bacteria by merely stepping onto it. yesterday it was mission impossible... honestly, most disgusting showers i have ever encounter! its not dirt of use, its dirt of not being cleaned.  this was my experience too a few months back in the dunfermline but admittedly i havent had to use them as much so cannot confirm if still the case -going there today, so ill update later.  the changing rooms and the gym floors are nice and clean, this message is only about the state of the showers.  i always recommended puregym to everybody: great gym network, good atmosphere, excellent pricing and, at the time, superb cleaning. what happened in the last few years?  i cannot be the first writing about this but regardless, i would really appreciate if you forward this message to someone who can act on it asap.  thanks."

1,2023-06-03,Pure Gym Beckton,"the beckton branch cannot keep staff, the staff that are there are clearly exhausted from covering excessive classes and spending a fortune on rent. the gym is oversubscribed! we can’t get on machines. having a pt is pointless at times when equipment isn’t free so the pts are also losing clients. it’s just a very obvious money making scheme. it used to be a really good place but i feel terribly sad for the people who work there and the culture pure gym has.  as soon as another gym options. as i’m sure there will be with the units available, i’ll happily transfer to that gym. i know this is a view across the gym.  updates: recently there’s been another resignation. since then the spin bikes are not repaired, the women’s toilets have only one toilet with a lock and doesn’t have toilet roll, the music cuts out in the class and the doors are locked so you can’t get in because of staff issues. we’re down to a few instructors and my pt finally left. 😢"
2,2023-06-03,Pure gym London Waterloo,"pure gym london waterloo, apparently the chain decided to do cost cutting on energy. after a work out you’ll be forced to have a warm ish shower and this situation is longer than 2 weeks. i just cancelled my membership for which i was paying £50/month and moved to another gym after more than 4 years i’m using this branch. thank you puregym london waterloo"
3,2023-06-03,Small free weights area so difficult to…,small free weights area so difficult to get a free bench even at less busy times. some equipment outdated....no displays on some rowing machines and treadmills. mens changing room has been refurbished recently but shower area needs renovation.... ceiling tiles full of mould spots in shower cubicles. overall not a bad gym for quick workouts.
1,2023-06-01,No air conditioning,"been a member for 6 years and there is still no air conditioning. a new manager each year or so and nothing changes. you try bring it up and they gaslight you, dismiss you, tell you to ""run slower"" on the treadmill. apparently this attitude is mainly reserved for women - men seem to be taken more seriously when they complain about the heat. horrible gym bro culture makes it unpleasant for women. do not recommend. place also stinks of sewage. am waiting for a new gym in the area then will change."

5,2023-05-13,No brainer!,"5 stars for the facilities and the concept of pure gym. great facilities and great ambience. unfortunately the staff, when visible, lacked any aptitude - enthusiasm can only help a small amount. the other thing is if your dd does not get honoured for any reason the penalty youre hit with is close to the monthly fee. excruciating - so deal breaker! sadly."

4,2023-05-30,Almost Perfect,"as previously mentioned, puregym cardiff central provides the perfect balance between great value for money and solid quality facilities in a highly welcoming environment suitable for those from 18 - 80! however, both legally blind and hearing impaired myself, ive found it somewhat frustrating to find the disabled access lift as well as the disabled access shower out of service on more than one occasion and for quite extended periods of time. arguably, these matters naturally occur and take time to resolve, but honestly, equal access for all should surely be at the forefront of any business in the 21st century, rather than being dealt with in a lackadaisical manner, regardless of potential challenges that can obviously arise."

4,2023-05-30,Good but could be better,"as usual, nice and clean. i did mainly cardio so there were plenty of machines to choose from. the free weight area looked busy though. would be better if there were more areas for stretching when theres a class in session. also, would be nice if staff said hello to patrons, especially to regulars."
1,2023-04-24,Avoid at all costs,"after joining puregym stratford when it opened, in january, my partner and i lasted less than four months at this establishment.  this is the most unhygienic gym we have visited; no wipe down stations, no paper towels, and embarrassing standards means equipment is greasy if not wet and wiping your hands on your own towel will literally leave marks after using any equipment.  the male changing rooms constantly smell like urine, and when gents enter the odour wafts out into the main floor. every time.  the management is incompetent. my partner and i eventually left after being physically threatened infront of a member of staff, who was less than enthused about dealing with the situation. after constant pressure to the ‘safe space’ team, he then turned around his story and started blaming us. apparently, gyms are full of testosterone and hormones, and so it’s perfectly natural that people threaten to wait outside the premises to harm you. tattooed manager, please get a new line of work.  a separate but related note: i was initially amused by the inclusion of a ‘sharps bin’ in the gents toilets. on reflection, i’m sure this is a bennie that the crack and/or meat heads really appreciate.  i cannot stress enough: avoid this gym. absolute embarrassment of an establishment."
4,2023-05-19,King Sion,"it’s the people that make the gym and met some fantastic people through the years. have made a lot of new friends by going to the classes. great bunch of trainers, especially robbie and lucy who have been there a long time. special mention to louis too (best newcomer award). sion is hands down the best manager i’ve seen at this gym. he always makes the effort to say hello and converse with members, not just the pretty ones. been at this gym since it opened and other managers could learn a lot from him. the dude before him was a bit quiet and awkward which was a bit surprising considering you see him a lot on the main pure socials. my only qualm with the gym is they’ve got a bit stingy on the air conditioning and equipment isn’t replaced/repaired very timely."

1,2023-05-22,Dissapointed,"dissapointed, gym is dirty, run down, and the staff can be rude and indiscreet. the manager doesnt seem to venture out of the office all day to understand the shortfalls of the establishment - and the assistant manager is hopeless, too young, with no life experience to run a gym. recently i was training with someone who said a member made a complaint about the female trainer, jelena, and the gym turned it around on the member and terminated their membership...makes me question continuing my business there, members should be free to give feesback  i would expect a manager to actually assist and run classes but it always seems a colleague has to cover them, even tho her name is on the app so it looks like she is doing them. if you are looking for a professionally run gym, this isnt it."

2,2023-05-29,Good gym gone bad,"been a member at gateshead for over a year and during that time the standards have continuously dropped. i put up with the dirty toilets with broken locks, broken lights and headsets that dont work in the studio, even having my name almost blacklisted because the instructor didnt tick my name off when id done the class - but the amount of classes that have been cancelled - often with no notification - is now beyond a joke. today was the last straw - i turned up for a class as did two others and the instructor said the class would have to be cancelled.... why?? there were three of us there and the instructor too, so why the need to cancel?? theres clearly some problems with this gym and im not putting up with unreliable classes. ill be cancelling my membership and finding a new gym asap."

5,2023-05-27,Kassidy Chaplin’s classes at PureGym Borough,"kassidy chaplin’s classes at puregym borough are outstanding. it is clear that he puts a high degree of importance on attention to detail, and he somehow manages to spot and help those who need adjustments in all his fully-booked classes to make sure that everyone has proper form and gets the most out of each class. he is a fun and motivational instructor, and his endless energy and enthusiasm are infectious and rub off on everyone in class, which brings the absolute best out of each one of us. kassidy’s abs class is the best i’ve ever been to. his lbt and bodytone classes are dynamic and incredibly fast-paced, and it’s amazing how much work can be done within a short time. his step classes are phenomenal - a 30 minute party in a gym - and the calorie burn is unbelievable. truly the best half hour of my week. kassidy’s experience, dedication and unique approach to instructing result in his classes always being fully-booked way in advance, which speaks for itself.  i’ve also been training with kassidy one-to-one at puregym borough for over a year. as a personal trainer, he is always thinking on his feet and using his expertise to adapt each training session according to space and equipment availability in the gym. he is always making modifications to suit my own personal needs and challenges (being short and hypermobile) so that i can get the most out of every single session whilst avoiding injury. he always keeps sessions upbeat and fun. he knows just how to motivate me to push my boundaries and enable me to grow beyond the limits of my mind, and he never accepts my fears as reasons to avoid doing something. i had always felt intimidated in gyms and felt that the gym life wasn’t for me, however training with kassidy has been an incredibly empowering experience, and i now train almost every day. after a break at the beginning of the year due to illness and surgery, i am now already stronger than i’ve ever been, and i am very grateful to him for guiding me safely, consistently and patiently. he is truly one of a kind in his profession."

1,2023-05-24,Thieves operate in Pure Gym,"pure gym lewisham, has its ups and downs, mostly down! i have been a member at this gym for a while. it was much better when it was run by fitness first, but then pure gym took it over. since then things just seem to go from bad to worse. if it wasnt for the personal trainers who are friendly and professional i would have left this gym a long time ago. the mens changing room and toilets tend to have an awful smell with leaks in the toilets on a regular basis. the hot water, as another member had pointed out, had been out of service for months. last year the bench in the changing room was not fixed down properly causing me injury and now just a few days ago my locker was broken into. all of my belongings were tipped out in the locker but nothing appeared to be missing, until i went shopping and noticed the cash i had in my wallet was gone. my cards were all still there but as a precaution i cancelled them just in case they had been skimmed. i reported it to staff who seemed to play it down and that a locker theft was rare and that it was the fault of a poor quality padlock. my padlock is of excellent quality!  i went to the police and reported the theft. the police said there wasnt much they could do but did state that thefts from this gym was quite regular and they have had a lot of members complaining to them. they said that pure gym needs to enforce their security but dont. when i went back in to the gym the next day i had to ask for a locker theft form, which i then completed. i was a bit surprised that this was not offered to me when i reported the theft to the staff that day. another member of staff then heard me talking about the break in and said not another one!  personally i dont think pure gym care as long as members keep paying membership. i now need to seriously think of finding another gym. just because this gym is convenient and close to my home is no longer a good excuse the remain a member here."

1,2023-05-25,This is a very poorly managed gym,"this is a very poorly managed gym . constantly asking members to post good reviews but doing absolutely nothing about the feedback . yes i agree with some reviews there are some great trainers but personally i feel the gym just can’t find people that are competent to manage it . very toxic culture and many would agree this is down to poor management. we all have our own views based on our own experiences and i’m afraid we will maybe disagree on who’s good who’s bad and so on . remember if you haven’t suffered at the hands of pure gym burnham then your perception will be different to others that have suffered. it’s run down , laura’s classes have been cut and i went to her classes regularly , that’s a loss to the gym as laura was brilliant every week . management and trainers need to start working on the gyms issues and politics but unfortunately they are the ones creating them . time to leave ."

4,2023-05-25,Cycle classes,"good gym with lovely, helpful staff. i enjoy the cycle classes, however some new bikes are needed as some are broken or on their way out and unsafe. more air conditioning could be pumped into the cycle studio during the classes, especially at this time of year as it becomes too hot and can restrict you in getting the best out of your workout. would also be good if there was a friday evening spin class option and/or the option of a sunday spin class."

1,2023-04-20,Fine when you want to go to the gym but if you need to cancel… good luck,"no button to cancel membership, they lead you in circles taking you from one page to the next then that takes you back to the one you were on. you shouldn’t have to complain online to cancel with a company this big and widely used. puregym shouldn’t be making it a pain in the ass to cancel so they can continue to take money from unhappy members."
3,2023-05-25,"I like the gym, but showers need cleaning more regularly","i like the gym, but the showers are filthy at times. today it looked like muddy shoes worn in the wet area and the shower cubicles looked that they hadnt been cleaned for days."

1,2023-05-25,Very difficult to obtain information…,"very difficult to obtain information about training courses. they intentionally have no information on the prices of training courses and force you to wait for a rep to call, and if you miss a call, i guess you need to go back to the website to complete the form again adn beg them to call. the course is extremely overpriced for online work. i can see why they do not put the prices on their site. i tried fb as they advised and was stuck in a pointless convo with a very rudimentary bot. it was impossible to get through to a person as the bot advised i had been placed in a queen and someone would get back to me in most cases within 12 hours. i thought this was a joke. previously i left a message on their site asking for advice on courses and when a woman called a day later, she was so rushed and unhelpful i was scared to talk to her, not to mention the unpleasant superior accent and tone of voice. what is going on with this place?  response to the pgs reply: trust pilot does not allow links. i was going to place a link to pure gyms personal training course page, but sure you claim whatever you want."

3,2023-05-25,Changes needed!!,"great gym to start with but now they turn the air conditioning off or put it so low that you cant feel it in the studio during classes, it leaves you feeling sick and dizzy as it gets too hot in there. hand dryer in the ladies bathroom has been broken for months, its not hard to get it fixed or replaced. the studio doesnt get cleaned everyday so theres always clumps of hair, dust and tissue all over the floor and in the same places for days so you know it doesnt get cleaned daily. staff are amazing and friendly, not their fault on some of the things that need improvement."

1,2023-05-25,Why does the website tell you to ring a number that just tells you to go to website???? I’ve been trying to book an induction…,"i’ve been trying to book an induction for nearly 2 months. i’ve had email’s ignored, emails that sent me to the website, website said to ring a number to book induction, this has answering message saying they are an online gym there is no telephone service - so why put it on the website and emails???? (unless it’s to make money on the calls?). i’ve been told to contact the gym manager (i have poor mobility) then i’m told to book on the website. yes! website tells me to book through the unmonitored telephone number. i’ve been doing this for nearly two months and still not booked in. then i find today that the £12.99 subscription goes up to £23.99 after 6 months (i may not have had induction by then).didn’t notice that in the small print. i have to have been a few times before i next see my physio so he can see any changes. i go in two weeks time. i’m going to zip round today on my mobility scooter to see if i can get any better service. if not i’m cancelling!!!!!!  update! finally received an email and have in induction booked on 28th may. i have also been given two weeks off my next subscription fee. thank you, finally, after a very frustrating time, a result. still looking forward to going, not put off but it was very close.  update: i had my induction. very quick i can’t remember half of it. if i wanted more i have to book a £45 personal trainer to help me plan my exercises. they were very friendly but more interested in how they would get me out of the building in an emergency. they also said i need to bring someone with me to assist me. my assistance dog wasn’t enough. i haven’t been able to find anyone so i have had to cancel my membership ☹️"

1,2023-05-24,Poor facillities,"no running water to fill up water bottle. as the weather heats up and with the lack of air con the least you could do is provide water. also the spin bikes are in terrible condition.  you are lucky if the screen works, pedal straps fly mid off sessions or are missing in action, resistance on the bikes is completely out of whack. classes are also too close together making it difficult to do back to back classes. why arent members consulted about scheduling? pure gym leeds south is neglected. managers no where to be seen."

1,2023-05-11,I’ve had to stop using this gym,"i’ve had to stop using this gym. i thought things were looking up recently when some new equipment was installed, but everything else is so beyond run down and dirty it’s unbearable to be there. you’d expect early morning, the gym would’ve been cleaned overnight for the day ahead, but even at 7am there were discarded paper towels and old water bottles surrounding all the equipment. the men’s changing rooms are a joke. there were/are blood and faeces on the toilet cubicle wall for over a year!! you’ll be lucky to find a secure locker too, as lots of them are broken. and to top it off the showers are now freezing cold! it’s not much to ask for a hot shower after a workout. seeing from another recent review, i’m not the only person to notice this. just because it’s a budget gym, it doesn’t mean standards have to slip this far. i doubt much will be done to fix the issues, but it needs to be addressed. i had already contacted the gym directly about the issues, only to be ignored."
1,2023-05-24,No air con & rude female PT,"the female pt jelena is rude. i have heard her complain about certain members, naming them to a staff member, who agreed with her and then proceeded to complain further.  there is no air con in the gym which is horrible, it’s too hot and the gym just smells."

3,2023-05-24,In need of investment,"i have been a member of pure gym for around 11 years, first of all merrion centre then hunslet when that opened. i feel that the gym has really gone downhill in recent months, especially in the changing/shower room. there is a strong smell from the drains in the showers. theres pretty much always at least one shower out of order and the other ones look like they need a bit of tlc with broken door handles and rubber beading coming away from the doors. it feels like a bit of investment is needed. i cant fault the trainers/coaches or the gym equipment but i am thinking of moving gyms because of the state of the showers."
1,2023-05-12,Duping people into long term contracts…,"duping people into long term contracts isnt really the best way to get people to like your gyms. make it easier to cancel your contracts not getting trapping people into long term commitments. also, poor equipment, poor customer service and poor design."

4,2023-05-21,Good gym,"a great gym, with all that you need for a good workout. can be a bit busy, hence the four stars instead of 5, and removing the walkway wall upstairs would allow them to fit in more equipment."
1,2023-05-22,No Hot Water Regularly!,no hot water regularly!! regular user of the halifax gym - and there seems to be a regular problem with providing hot water for showers!! - if you need to raise the monthly payment to include hot water can you please organise this as the temperature of the hot water is as best tepid...if working at all.. get your act together.. :(

2,2023-05-14,Lacking,only one room for classes and it’s impossible to ever get on a class if you work full time - unless you’re a top paying member. induction could be more involved with personal advice in how to achieve goals.

5,2023-05-22,Really enjoyable Zumba classes,"really enjoyable zumba classes. good class availability with 3 different days a week. it is worth getting the plus membership where you can bring a friend with you for free up to 8 times a month, worth it."

3,2023-05-22,Gym Let Down By Staff,"gym is perfectly okay, personal trainers are not. the gym is lacking a few pieces of equipment which can be found in other puregyms but is always tidy with lots of space. the personal trainers, except for a couple, are unfriendly and unhelpful to the point of being rude, in particular leon coupe. i am no longer going to be using this facility as i felt very unwelcome and stressed after encounters with them."
4,2023-05-22,Good equipment and clean,"would like another spinning class on the 0900 time scale. over all,  good"
2,2023-05-14,I’ve been coming for a couple months…,i’ve been coming for a couple months now and the showers are awful freezing cold for first 5 mins then warm up then go boiling and back to freezing - it makes me run late for work every morning and haven’t worked for the 2 months i’ve been going

3,2023-05-22,Tepid showers but good basic gym,if you want hot showers then don’t join. otherwise a good value gym for the price
3,2023-05-22,The puregym is amazing value for money…,the puregym is amazing value for money . great enthusiastic friendly staff and good equipment.  downside lack of antibacterial gel and spray for hygiene should be an essential.  also very crowded at times .
1,2023-05-22,Pure gym - dirty…,"pure gym - bidston moss, i only came back as combat is on a monday & tuesday morning, - most classes are good but not enough cardio high intensity classes available in the morning, here’s a list of what needs attention asap.  most bikes don’t work in the spin room absolutely a joke…. so you get in there to get set up and find one doesn’t work so you move to the next and then that doesn’t work!!  clock doesn’t work in studio upstairs hasn’t worked for months….  woman’s bathroom - most of the time the woman’s toilets are dirty and sanitary bins not emptied it’s disgusting 🤮 second toilet in woman’s bathroom missing toilet seat, it’s been like this for months!!  windows inside and out filthy top of the gym & bottom, pure gym sticker signs faded outside and worn out.  fans are dusty & dirty all round the gym 🤮  general standard of gym not good enough. how is the acceptable and why aren’t these things being looked at? environmental health may be called by someone if something isn’t done as this is not okay."
1,2023-05-15,Awful,awful! no staff available and went two weeks before cancelling after not being able to get my code reset as no one answered the phone!
5,2023-05-22,Brilliant spin class Elen,brilliant spin class elen! great atmosphere and well worth the early start.
4,2023-05-22,Improvements needed,"the gym itself and the equipment is really good, the only downside which needs improving on is the cleanliness of the shower area."
5,2023-05-22,Great gym. Needs attention to PT etiquette.,"i love pure gym. it’s a great gym at a great price. good quality equipment, and a good atmosphere. it’s clean and i highly recommend it.  i have found that recently; pt’s seem to be setting up for a class an hour before it’s due to start, they then do another class in the meantime. i fully understand it’s to save time in setting up between classes, but it takes over a large portion of the gym, creates trip hazards and is just inconvenient. (cones, battle ropes, landmine rows etc).  class goers seems to have priority of use over equipment, and it’s all set up ‘an hour’ before their class even starts and they need to use the equipment. it’s just becoming very frustrating."
4,2023-05-14,Access and equipment is good,"access and equipment is good, but there are not enough showers for demand."
5,2023-05-19,Gym Visit.,"the staff are very approachable & happy to help with any query, very knowledgeable."
2,2023-05-21,"12 weeks of membership, consistent issues…","been a member for 12 weeks and in that time: - ladies toilet hand dryer has been broken the entire time. - aircon is never on. the place stinks and is so hot in there now the weather is improving that it makes me feel physically sick before i’ve even started. tonight i was dripping sweat and nauseous after 15 minutes and i’d only done gentle seated hip ab/adductions and was contemplating leaving, and that was 5pm. i can’t face the idea of going at midday on hot days. - when staff are there they’re never at the desk. stood waiting 15+ minutes trying to flag staff about something but in the end gave up as had too much to do to keep waiting. - disabled parking is in no way enforced, regularly full of non-badge users leaving wheelchair users unable to access the gym and walking disabled like myself struggling to get in/out of regular spaces."
5,2023-05-21,Spin class very well run and enjoyable,spin class very well run and enjoyable. the girl that took it took time to explain everything to us and walked around halfway through to see if we were ok. i like the 30 min classes    in do a workout then out. great.
5,2023-05-21,Great gym classes,"i absolutely love the classes at this gym! the instructors are enthusiastic and competent, and i always leave a class with a big smile on my face. each instructor brings their own unique style, making every class a fresh experience. the only suggestion i have would be to add some late pilates/yoga classes to the evening schedule. overall, a great gym with friendly staff and superb classes :)"

3,2023-05-04,Better secure bike parking please.,"its a real shame there isnt better provision for secure bike parking. there is a bike rack next to the car park, but it isnt secure enough considering the rampant bike theft problem in the area. something similar to deros bike depot is needed, please."
4,2023-05-21,Love the classes BUT the gym seriously…,love the classes but the gym seriously needs air conditioning in the spin classes!!

1,2023-05-21,poor gym,poor gym.  equipment damaged and never repaired.  staff absent and not interested in solving problems.  cleaning stations removed so be prepared to use non-disinfectant machinery.  the app never logs weekend visits so its useless.  one piece of advice dont waste your money at this gym
5,2023-05-21,Great gym :),im a very anxious person and the staff are so friendly - i work very close to the gym and it’s always lovely to see a friendly face. the gym makes me feel very safe so would reccomend for anyone whos nervous or looking to start out :)

1,2023-05-20,Help links essential lead to non…,help links essential lead to non relevant answers e.g s list of possible answers which seems to be based on buzz words in the question.for further information you have to have a facebook or linked in account which i dont have .why cant i use e mail.i was a previous la fitness member and transfered based on the agreement that fees would not be increased going forward.fees have been increased and i have not been able to communicate my dissatisfaction for the reasons above .   contractual questions for the same reasons are not answered information on website is inaccurate.i recently logged into my account for a list of clubs my membership allowed me access to only to find it was inaccurate when i attempted access to the club i could not and was referred to the unhelpful links above.

5,2023-05-20,Friendly PT Richard gave me a tour around,"richard gave me a tour around, in a professional and friendly maneer, i signed up to the gym. thank you!"
2,2023-05-20,Good gym,"good gym, equipment is great however the workers were unpleasant towards us, a male worker was looking at us funny and when we was leaving he pulled a dirty look at us."
4,2023-05-13,It’s a good gym,"it’s a good gym, good positive environment, it’s just that it lacks a few bits of equipment and isn’t always as clean as you’d like. they need to take their littering policy more seriously."
5,2023-05-20,The legs bums & tums,the legs bums & tums i had this morning was amazing. this time we used weights. it lasted 45mins. i have to learn to lift weights  correctly so looking forward to my next class next week learn to lift. i am sure i will get more confident as the staff are very helpful & friendly.

5,2023-05-20,Fantastic Staff at Great Yarmouth,"fantastic staff at great yarmouth. special thank you to dorota, rebecca, harvey, kim & luke. at nearly 49 & a lazy chunky old bird; i’m enjoying regular gym for the 1st time ever. even making a regular class saturday’s at 9:15 in the am!! fabulous classes to work all areas of body. 🤞🏻i’m starting to not wobble as much 💋💋 all for a mega low monthly fee! such value."
1,2023-05-16,Disappointing,i joined this gym in order to attend pilates that was advertised as being 1 of the classes they were offering. however turns out they are not offering pilates! i attended a stretch class on the opening night. i waited longer for the class starting than the length of time of the whole class took. very disappointed!
4,2023-05-20,Overall good gym,"overall good gym, only negative is that often theres a bad smell in the toilet within the men changing room."
1,2023-05-19,unfortunately this is a scam,they are making money together with the parking company. you will register your vehicle at the terminal and the company will send you a £170 fine. this will likely be split with pure gym. very good money maker.
4,2023-05-20,the Gym is well run and clean with the…,"the gym is well run and clean with the correct behaviour from members. the equipment is maintained and there is space in which to ensure that the use of the equipment does not impede anyone else. the changing rooms are kept reasonably clean but members have a duty to ensure that they bin their rubbish and dont leave it for other people to clean up. there is still a shower out of order and has been for some time. the temperature of the showers has been turned down which is a poor decision and done without any kind of consultation with members. after a workout a hot shower is helpful in relaxing strained muscles, a luke warm one isnt ."
4,2023-05-19,Every thing is good especially cleaning…,every thing is good especially cleaning man he is lovely guy and he works hard always but ive two point first i dont know whats the advantage of low sonde music in gym almost you cant heard nothing. secondly there is no air condition in changing room you cant feel stream air and you feel chook always especially in rush hour. thanks for your attention.🙏🌹
1,2023-05-14,No Information about memberships before buying.,"they make you buy membership without many information and fees, and after you paid on the next month you get charged with over double starting from 20 and getting to 60 when checking your bank account."
5,2023-05-19,there is one problem in changing room,"there is one problem in changing room, bit no safety,some body trying to unlock my padlock, happened twice this week"
4,2023-01-19,"Good Price, great classes, great mix of equipment","the gym is quite centrally located so it’s easily walkable for me and very easy to find (it’s on the roadside) so that’s good.  i like the variety of equipment as well. they got the obvious treadmills and cross trainer which is great but the gym is quite big enough to have like a rowing machine and those stationary bikes which i prefer using. they also have the equipment to help build muscle but i haven’t yet gotten to try them out as there’s always someone on them so i won’t be able to comment on it. i have tried some strength classes and those were very good (the instructor is actually very demanding, which i like for a good workout but in case it isn’t for others, i though i’d mention it).  i really love the gym classes that they have. i think there’s a good amount of them running during the day, however, if i had a slight complaint, i’d say there’s sometimes a bit of confusion during bank holidays if the classes will go ahead. some do some don’t and you don’t really find out until the day so maybe a heads up for things like that would be great.  there’s sanitary stations in the gym so that’s cool, however, on of them looks quite old so i think it should be replaced, perhaps.  i pay £24.99 which i think is a good price for the gym. i mainly got the option because i tend to go to the gym either quite early or quite late and occasionally during peak hours so i like knowing whenever i have time in my day to go i can.  i believe my subscription gives me access to acton and park royal puregyms as well, so that’s a nice bonus.  the app is also easy to use. it’s labelled nicely so you can tel where you are where to find classes and also to track your workout activity (although it’s a very basic form of it, you see your workout history, achievements, streaks and workout time but that’s about it). i like that there’s digital workouts on there which i think is useful if you want to do yoga at home.  overall, i do think it’s a very good service for the price save for a few minor things highlighted. i’m not sure if it’ll be the same for all gyms across the country but i’ll say it’s worth trying out."
3,2023-05-14,Disappointed,great class however due to changes with timetable extremely disappointed with lack of classes on a friday and saturday
5,2023-05-14,They are very welcoming and keep it…,they are very welcoming and keep it clean
4,2023-05-13,I can only give 4 stars because…,i can only give 4 stars because crayford gym is blessed only by rebecca burnett who carries out the best workout classes which actually makes me want to book back to back every saturday on all three of her classes every saturday since january. the fact that rebecca is no longer doing the classes come june is the reason i didn’t give 5 stars and probably won’t be booking on any future classes as i have booked on others but quite frankly have been extremely poor workouts with very poor choice of music and directions. but not rebecca’s. i’ll miss the weekend classes and hope rebecca is back doing them very soon x
4,2023-05-19,Good experience,"friendly approachable staff excellent equipment good classes available easy in and out of gym ,great bus rout and parking facilities clean well equipped locker and shower area"
5,2023-05-15,Roger That!,"roger that! aerobics teacher is great. i’ve never done a class like this before, but he made me feel at ease!!!! he needs to be teaching 7 days a week💪"
4,2023-05-14,I love the quantity and variety of gym…,i love the quantity and variety of gym equipment and thr classes are great - just don’t think the cleanliness is very good.  i can’t see any stations containing equipment to wipe machines down and they are very dirty and sweaty already. people aren’t encouraged in any way to clean equipment after using.  secondly there is no wifi and was told this was delayed for a couple of weeks.  it’s such a lovely space but the above is just letting it down when they could do so much better.
5,2023-05-16,My best of gym...,always great workout.
4,2023-05-19,"Good Gym, but can always improve","i go to pure gym 5/6 times a week and thoroughly enjoy the gym in andover.  i mainly go to classes in the week and i find ash and vickys are the most motivational and upbeat there! great music and they keep you going every second! i do pt with vickie at the gym also, and she is a fantastic teacher!  things to work on: - the parking 100% needs to be reviewed as is always chocka! is there any spaces we can park if you are full? - spin bikes there is a lot in there that do not work which can be frustrating! please can we look at this as means a lot of classes are full up with minimum people. - the showers are freezing so this needs to be fixed please. - is there aircon? it is always super hot in there and smells horrible, with the summer coming up please can this be reviewed. - i have also turned up a few times and my class has been cancelled but no one has emailed out...please work on this especially when you drive 40 odd minutes from work to get there! - after loosing 6 stone i feel amazing but the scales are hit and miss often telling me i am 1ft lol.  overall 9/10 but pure gym just needs to fix a few bits for a 10/10 :) would recommend"
2,2023-05-13,Toilets stink,"toilets stink, showers stink, air con is never on, 3 staff in office and none ever come out and do any cleaning 😔"
4,2023-05-14,I love this gym but…,"i love this gym. it’s affordable for students which i love and it has all the equipment you need to workout. my only thing is whenever i visit, it is always so hot in there making it extremely difficult to work out as you don’t have as much respiration. it’s not the right temperature saying it’s a gym."
2,2023-05-14,The showers are dirty,"the showers are dirty. they do not drain and the standing water has encouraged yellow/brown bacteria. mopping out will not do, a real scrub is required. the equipment is old. wear on cycles, steps and ellipticals causes vibrations when using them. this is low cost cardio, that is the only reason i keep returning."
5,2023-05-19,Lovely atmosphere all staff are very…,lovely atmosphere all staff are very helpful and friendly also easy to approach. all round brill gym.
1,2023-05-14,Most of the lockers were broken on the…,most of the lockers were broken on the first floor. the installer that have joined after the pandemic are rubbish. as taken a few classes that i use to take before the pandemic and they were all rubbish. i have now cancelled my membership as not only does the classes not suit me  anymore but the instructors are not engaging
2,2023-05-13,"Greedy, disingenuous company…","changing membership levels is very difficult - cant be done for a significant portion of the month around fee payment date, which is a nonsense reason - you should still be able to select a downgrade for the next month. instead the whole membership change module is deactivated for around a week either side of payment date. you can also only downgrade one level at a time. shockingly greedy behaviour! gym is also crowded and machines are often broken."

5,2023-05-14,Really love the gym only negative…,really love the gym only negative comment is when there are studio classes you can hear everything in the main gym - the instructor & music which is a little off putting when you are trying to listen to your own music or chat
5,2023-05-19,Brilliant,"clean, friendly staff plenty of equipment"

3,2023-05-14,The gym is overall great,"the gym is overall great. however, whenever something is broken (like the treadmills) it takes quite a while to be fixed. also, i would like to see more cycle and bootcamp classes (the availability is too loo in the mornings)"
5,2023-05-14,Good range of equipment,"good range of equipment, can get busy but that’s to be expected with the quality and price!"
1,2023-05-19,I do not recommend,"i do not recommend. the management are very unprofessional and full of false promises especially when it comes to equipment being fixed. the toilets being in use when they clearly are flooded and management do not run the gym efficiently. it’s like a school playground . if you raise any sort of issue in the gym they will dislike you for it. reading the previous reviews regarding 2 members, nathan and helen. i was shocked to read about their experiences. never have i heard of a gym affecting people like this. its safe to say i’ll be going elsewhere."
5,2023-05-14,Puregym is the best !,"puregym is the best !! the condition of the equipment is excellent, the gym is clean,there is water dispenser with different flavours water which is cool and u can use for free with your membership. the best thing for me is that u can get gym buddy with you , few times per month 👌🤩. its open 24/7 and definitely if u need some quiet time for workout u can fit yourself in perfect time for you. i like so much the app, u can check any time how many people are in the gym, etc. i recommend it ☝️"
3,2023-05-18,"Clean and secure, but not great experience with classes early on","gym access is secure, which is a comfort, and it was very clean. the low rating stems from (1) a class cancellation with no explanation and (2) my second class being crammed into the main gym floor where we were in the way, and it was almost cancelled as i was the only one who turned up (which is hardly fair on me as a paying customer who was keen to attend)! not confident going forward, but hopefully these 2 blips won’t reoccur."

5,2023-05-14,Budget gym,"budget gym, but fully equipped and reasonably clean."
4,2023-05-14,Teething issues,not had any real issues and always a hassle free environment. only downsides ive come across so far are the lack of wifi in the gym which is still ongoing after 2 months and the amount of time it takes them to repair broken equipment. there has been a chest machine broken for well over a month now which in a busy gym is ridiculous. otherwise a great place to go and work out
3,2023-05-14,Could have much more equipment,"could have much more equipment, lots of wasted space , lots of wasted time waiting for equipment at peak times , nice new gym however"
5,2023-05-19,First time at pure gym and it was very…,"first time at pure gym and it was very clean and had a lot of equipment. simple, easy and straightforward to get the pin and do everything online. brilliant 🤩"
2,2023-05-14,Neglected maintenance.,"i have been using pure gym for almost 2 years, to begin with it was great, cleaner and more practical than most other gyms in the area. but as time goes on it has become neglected; water constantly broken, machines that are broken are left broken for longer than they should be before getting fixed, vending machines constantly out of order or simply don’t give you anything even after paying. the biggest issue is that machines are not regularly maintained, meaning that they are rough to use and break more often than not.  overall the gym is still useable of course and because of my proximity to it is still my best option, for the price too. however the consideration to switch to a different gym in the area is on my mind as i have heard from other people and by my own visits to other gyms that they are better maintained and managed."
4,2023-05-19,Like the gym just no boxing bags,"really like the gym, the pure gym app is really easy to follow and really motivating for someone who goes to the gym solo, one thing this gym is missing is boxing bags i’m sure others would enjoy to either start or end their workout with a session on the boxing bags! apart from boxing bags i believe the gym has every other thing needed to satisfy my workout"

4,2023-05-14,Decent gym,not really been much in the day but quiet early hours good use of equipment
3,2023-05-14,Credit to the staff team,"the instructor made this visit good overall. however, the studio space is too small for busier classes so booking availability should be reduced and more classes offered. there’s a lack of aircon in the studio which makes classes uncomfortable. the gym overall gets busy and would benefit from more equipment, particularly weights. there are no cleaning wipes or sanitizer throughout which is very disappointing. it’s members of the staff team that make the experience and subscription price worthwhile as opposed to it being because of the gym’s facilities."

4,2023-05-14,Good classes but studio space too small,"pros: classes are good, easy to park, has everything you need in the main area is good  cons: studio room needs to be bigger or make the class numbers smaller. 27 spaces for a class like pump is way too many for the space and it’s quite cramped even with 23 people"

3,2023-05-14,Hotter than the sun.,"puregym yate is well equipped, people are nice enough and equipment rotates quickly when in use.  staff don’t really interact at all, sit behind their desk and play on their phones. music is really loud when they’re there and really quiet when not.  it’s hotter than the sun in therr, there’s aircon units on the ceiling but they seem unwilling to use them in any kind of anger.  active across the road have just invested £250k in new equipment so worth a look before you commit. the staff there in comparison are much better and it’s a better environment generally but lack equipment compared to pure."

4,2023-05-14,Great Womens area,"i train at the women’s section, it’s great now that it has expanded but it can get really busy. the central area is used for circuit classes which is generally fine but sometimes there isn’t much equipment left for the rest to use or even the area in which they train can get crowded. i am overall happy with the gym as it’s priced great and one of the better ladies section."

4,2023-05-13,Not safe to squat..,"there is absolutely nowhere in there to squat safely with weight. there are no safeties on the lifting platforms so you are unable to squat heavy safely there (this is really where the safeties should be). the only squat safeties are on a squat rack but its not a lifting floor! its a very unsafe soft floor that is just asking for ankle and knee injuries. however, good little gym for excellent price. just think many powerlifters/those who want to squat may start leaving when they want to lift heavy safely."

4,2023-05-13,Well equipped,"as clean & well equipped as a brand new gym ought to be!! i really appreciate that there’s a choice of barbells for both weightlifting & powerlifting, as well as proper weightlifting platforms. it felt like on a busy session the weights for the barbells would run out pretty quickly though, as even with just 3 racks in use there was a lot of demand on 15s & 20s.  dropping a star as a couple of machines already out of order & the limited availability of classes after work hours.  some idiot dude crossed my platform twice in the middle of my sets, but the chap working in the gym was more observant & waited until i finished & struck up a nice conversation, that was super welcoming :) (made up for the idiot!)"

1,2023-05-13,There are lot of things to improve,there are lot of things to improve  there should be enough attachments for equipments as there are hardly 1-2 in such big gym.  increase equipment of common workouts.  very important:- install a manual weighing scale instead of paid weighing scale

3,2023-05-13,"Gym is great, could use a few improvements","gym is great, plenty of different machines/areas, staff are great and facilities are always clean!  however, the showers are always freezing, most classes are on throughout the day when most people are at work so i think there should be more classes on the weekends/evenings, there is no cleaning station so your unable to clean the machines yourselfs and the air con is never cool enough😕"
5,2023-05-13,Happy to have moved to Puregym.,"the staff are pleasant and helpful.  plenty of mat room and lots of equipment - i never have to queue for anything. lots of car parking space.i was a long time member at another local gym, never got this sort of experience.  very pleased to have moved to puregym."
4,2023-05-13,It’s a good gym but some equipments…,it’s a good gym but some equipments need to be fixed quicker
2,2023-05-13,Not enough weight plates for benches,"not enough weight plates for benches, spent half the workout trying to scrape together enough 20kg plates. weights all over the place, left on machines. no staff available when issues with guest getting in the door, took over 10 minutes to get some assistance."
1,2023-05-17,Waiting for equipment is ridiculous,"i havent been to puregym yet, im writing this review based on what my mother has said. my mum has been to puregym twice and she said that the last time she went it was like waiting to get on a rollercoaster. all of the equipment was occupied and people were waiting to use the equipment, i wanted to go today but my mum denied it because she doesnt want me to wait around with strangers just to use a treadmill. im honestly disappointed because im so happy that a gym has opened near me and im already hearing bad things about it. if you want an idea of a gym to be fun, motivating, and useful at least have a limit on how many people can go in or get more equipment."
2,2023-05-11,A sheep dip would be cleaner than your showers 🤮☠️😩,"ive been a member of this gym for about 2 years and ive noticed that the hygiene and cleanliness standards for the mens changing room have deteriorated somewhat, particularly the showers that have a dreadful stench to them. i think maybe the drains need clearing or changing.  if you scroll down at other reviews of this gym, there is a consistent complaint about the poor standards in the changing room, toiles and showers. the other thing that is pretty consistent is the robotic standard response saying that they take it into account yet changed nothing for over half a year.  it regularly stinks of weed in the changing rooms and in the stairwell.  furthermore ive noticed that theres a lot of chopping and changing of classes, primarily due to the high churn of pt staff. it makes it more difficult to get into and stick to a regular fitness routine with pts and classes you enjoy when the schedule is constantly changing. i think in the time ive been a member of this gym i need both hands to count the changes in management.  i like this gym, i like the team, although i know only a few of them now. i want it to do well, but i also think puregym hq needs to invest some time and money in helping them bring it back up to standard"
3,2023-05-16,Super busy at times,super busy at times - they could really do with adding some more equipment as you can end up waiting ages for something to become available.  doesnt help that when some equipment breaks it takes them months to repair it (current example being one of the cable machines being out of action for the past month).
4,2023-05-16,Good gym,"good gym, spacious n lots of eqipments. air quality on weekends is a bit low. once something is broken, takes ages to be fixed. helpful staff"

1,2023-05-16,It’s an absolute joke,"it’s an absolute joke, every week it’s either a leak, no air conditioning, no hot water, no towels & just yesterday no changing rooms so i had to change in the utility room. how is it justifiable being the most expensive pure gum in london with the shambolic conditions i don’t even know. if it wasn’t next door to work i wouldn’t even bother and to be fair i’m considering leaving. the staff are great and do their best but this gym is the worst puregym i’ve ever used & i’m not exaggerating."

4,2023-05-16,Very good gym (Pure Gym Otford) but it…,"very good gym (pure gym otford) but it would be good to limit numbers at peak times now there are lots of members, as it is getting difficult to get on equipment at times and lots of young lads really hog weights machines with loads of sets, long gaps between sets and faffing about on their phones. also when i go at a quieter time in the day it is often super noisy when a spin class is on - would be good if the room had a door and soundproofing, i can hear the shouting and music well above the music in my headphones. maintenance could also be a bit quicker to repair equipment- i go three times a week and sometimes the same machine is out of order for a week or two. but overall a good, easy, cheap gym."
3,2023-05-12,It's not amazing,"its not amazing. always too busy and always too small. should have more equipment and more floor space. i always struggle to find the equipment i need, as its always in use... its also very stuffy, bit smelly and too hot. the womens changing room have the loudest hand dryer that gives me literal headaches whenever its activated (which is all the time). i wish they had proper spin bikes too, not the cheap stationary bikes. i continue to use this gym because its the only one in my area. would have changed to something more suitable if i had the choice."
5,2023-05-12,I have noticed the last few weeks that…,i have noticed the last few weeks that the cleanliness isnt as good as it used to be. the floor is extremely dirty to the point where you cant put a jumper on the floor.
5,2023-05-17,Take the pump class!,"it was my first time at the gym today, and as i didnt know what i was really doing a took a weight class with anthony, he was welcoming and informative and definitely put me through my paces but i enjoyed every minute of it"

5,2023-05-17,"Nice gym, filled with nice people and great equipment","great gym, always filled with a positive atmosphere from other people."
5,2023-05-16,Best gym in Ballymena,"we went for the first time this evening (opening day). was a fantastic experience, really well laid out with changing rooms/toilet facilities on the second floor (they also have a lift). the equipment i used had explanations on how to use and each piece of equipment is colour coded in regards to which area of the body it is used to work. the equipment is all in the same area for each body part (eg all the equipment used to work your arms is in the same area). good selection in the vending machines. really clean changing area/locker area with hairdryers and a machine (costs £1) to measure your weight, height, bmi etc. showers are decent too. staff are incredibly friendly and always available to help if/when needed. although we walked there is also free parking for a certain length of time. there is a poundland next door too.  only issues were there is only one cubicle for changing after using the shower and lockers were on the smaller side, however the pros definitely outweigh the cons!"
4,2023-05-13,Classes at PureGym,i enjoy the classes and the weights etc are easy to use. the class sizes are quite full though and if doing a pump or class using the weights theres not enough room as you have to stand quite close to the next person. it is quite difficult to book a class as they get booked up quickly.
5,2023-05-12,Happy and helpful staff,"happy and helpful staff, feel very comfortable to ask for advice and help."

2,2023-05-15,I’m really disappointed in the fact…,"i’m really disappointed in the fact that if you are doing a workout and in the middle of a session you can be asked to remove yourself from a machine if a class is starting and the people in that class need it.  its not the staffs fault i know but i pay my membership the same as others and should be able to complete my session..surely if you are in the middle of a workout you should be able to finish?  today at my local (galashiels branch) i was trying to beat my best performance on the rowing machine when i was interrupted.. the instructor asked me to finish up what i was doing and to give priority to the class..  i mean the instructor he was polite enough but being politely asked to stop your workout isn’t going to get me back to fitness.  this has happened to me twice now, once before work at 6am when i was trying to get a session in on the rower and now after work.  coming back from a running injury it’s my go to machine to workout on ..tonight after being asked to finish up on the rower again half way through my session and with almost all other machines busy, i was forced to change my session and end it early.  this needs sorted out, either by adding more rowers or having an alternative exercise for the class when someone is using the a machine?  come on puregym, this is a poor show"

4,2023-05-16,Great place but not enough equipment…,"great place but not enough equipment for number of members and at peak times it is beyond a joke. this is only exasperated by people sitting on the equipment whilst checking their phones and even talking on their phones. also no (not very often) cleaning staff over the weekend,"

5,2023-05-16,Nice experience overall,nice experience overall. good variety of equipment. the one thing lacking is a chair in the showers for the less able. it is awkward to put footwear on whilst standing. there is a fold down seat in the actual shower but it needs drying and the floor is wet. apart from that it’s a good gym

2,2023-05-14,Weekends are always terrible,"weekends are always terrible. equipment everywhere, no blue roll or spray and worst of all no loo roll. i’ve learnt to bring my own if i train there at the weekend. you have to search for everything you need to use. wait ages to use equipment while the current user watches tv on their phone or spends an eternity on instagram. weight plates are like gold dust, you search for the ones you need for ages and then have to hoard them until you’ve finished your sets. but, still i come back because during the week it’s like a different gym. the manger is attentive and on the ball, makes sure her gym is in pristine condition and everything is where it should be and most importantly members are happy"

1,2023-05-13,Equipment risk..but the gyms cheap.,"positives: gym is clean, well presented inside with a good layout. has a lot of equipment mostly. 24 hours access classes table water access good changing rooms locker access ""need a padlock""  negatives: car parking length is restricted to 2 1/2 hours. lacks exercise bikes if thats your thing. also no tv on any cardio equipment gym is overly busy unless you wish to train at 1-5am in the week. weekends are quieter. a lot of under 18s now at the gym. some members are letting non gym members in the gym during unstaffed hours. a lot of people are breaking equipment or messing with equipment which can cause harm to others.  i myself have suffered a cut on my arm from a metal ring off a pin which was securely into the weights at 32kg which is not heavy and shouldnt of popped off. i now have a permeant scar which is still red and enflammed over a tattoo petal which is quite annoying. i have raised it to deputy and gym manager and was just told that it shouldnt of happened and that was it. i have been to over 15 other gyms throughout my lifetime and never had any cause of injury from equipment. their appears to be new broken equipment every time i have been to the gym so not sure if i can trust the equipment. this appears accross some of the other puregym gyms as friends have also raised this to me once they were aware of my recent issue.  so if your on a cheap budget, dont mind busy gym with over 50-150 members in the gym except between 1-5am and can risk injury from equipment then this gym would be good for you.  if your concerned then perhaps ask for a day trial to see how you feel.  this review is completely a honest review on my expierence at the gym.  may i add customer service via the main customer server team via messenger was very helpful when i first was signing up.  amended to 1 star from 2 star, as puregym replied to my review and didnt read it all as i have already mentioned in this review i have contacted the manager and deputy manager of the gym without a response."

1,2023-01-01,A Gym Best to Avoid,"i used a three day free trial at this gym to try it out as i wanted to join a gym. the first thing i noticed was that i could only go to the specific gym i had the pass for. i only noticed this once trying to gain access to the putney gym... but the code to enter didnt work. this wasnt a great start. the problem with these gyms being unstaffed is that you cant actually speak to anyone to resolve the issue and gain entry. you cant even phone them as they dont have a phone number. all you can do is email them and wait several hours for an answer, but why would you waste several hours waiting outside a gym for an answer to an email? very impractical  i then walked to the gym in wandsworth town which is the gym i had initially selected and fortunately gained access. i tried this gym out for three days and it also seemed like it was usually unstaffed. i at least managed to gain access and was able to exit the gym without much ado. although, needing a code to gain entrance and the gym being unstaffed didnt fill me with much confidence if the emergency services would need to gain immediate access due to needing a code to get in. if they did manage to get in by some quirk of fate, and needed to stretcher someone out then theres no way in a thousand years theyd be able to carry anyone out on a stretcher through those pods - even if they had a code.  i know they have their emergency leaver in case of an emergency, but they would still struggle to get in even if the emergency button worked properly.  from reading other reviews it seems like the emergency button has been used before and there was no help available.  for these reasons i would not recommend using this gym, even if it is somewhat cheaper than the competitors. the lower price comes at a higher risk!"

2,2023-05-14,Not for the weightlifters!,"genuinely the worst puregym i’ve been to! i travel quite a bit so often use different puregyms across the uk, this one was the worst. the bars are all thick old wolversons, no womens weightlifting bars or men’s weightlifting bars. one set of bumper plates that are far past their lifespan and a wonky platform. the dumbbell section was completely dismantled and you had to just find one on the floor. it’s understandable that not all gyms aren’t equipped for weightlifters but this one lacked even the basics for casual gym goers."

5,2023-05-12,Excellent gym,"excellent gym. open 24 hours, a lot of equipment. the only thing i dont like is the app. it is too slow.  i need to launch it at home, by the time i arrive at the gym it is ready to be used. also it keeps kicking me out, need to log in so often."
4,2023-05-12,"Good gym, with little nit picks","i really like puregym durham. its all very modern and clean. it is what you expect with the other members who use it. expect a lot of people with there head down in phones and groups of teens around one bench. but i have noticed the members are pretty good at cleaning up there weights. the music could be better and louder and the floor staff dont pay any acknowledgment to the members what so ever. ive been going for over a month and never been given a ""hello"" spin classes rock the gym and can also be slightly off putting. but ........ i like the handy app to get into the gym and there is a great range of equipment."
1,2023-05-13,"Unhygienic, packed full of inconsiderate people, faulty and old machinery",ive been to a lot of puregyms and this one has to be one of the worst. basic housekeeping is absolutely shocking - the toilets go for days with no toilet roll or soap which is unbelievably unhygienic and they have completely run out of blue roll at times. it is always way too busy and full of members with no etiquette who take up multiple machines/equipment at one time and are never advised by staff to be considerate of others. the machines and facilities are always broken - one toilet has been out of order for over two months. they have barely had any new equipment for the two years ive been a member and they are lacking extremely basic gym equipment like a decent lat pull-down or cable row. honestly dont waste your time - even the price doesnt make up for this mess

5,2023-05-13,"Decent, low cost and their newer gyms are much better quality","decent, low cost gyms. been to two puregyms (london catford rushy green and london woolwich). both have been open less than a year so very new, and low cost, although theyve surged their prices since the inflation increase post-covid. both the gyms i went to are spacious, ventilation has been good and the catford rushy green gym has never been too busy; having 10 squat racks is a dream!  i do wish there was someone to speak to on the phone. i guess one of the areas puregym cut costs is on having no phone line customer service; i sometimes have to wait up to 48 hours to have the simplest of changes made to my account that cant be done online and would be instantly doable if i was able to speak to someone on the phone.  i also have a bolt-on to bring a friend with me to the gym. the only problem is the pin can only be used by one friend. meanwhile at gym group, i can create a temporary pin for any friend who i bring, they do not have to create an account but only fill a questionnaire. i can bring multiple friends on another pin, but that means me contacting member services via im or email, which, again, takes sometimes days before they respond.  the music can get quite repetitive as well, but i guess thats because im in the gym four times a week. never attended any of the classes. i do wish more of their squat racks had safety pins."

1,2023-05-12,Place is filthy and overcrowded,place is filthy and overcrowded. absence of staff means that a certain type of customer - usually young men in vests - walk around as if they own the place/being rude and entitled hurrying people off of machines.
1,2023-05-13,Shocked,"visited first week this gym opened, quite shocked. former bodybuilder/frequent gym user. i read how in a week the gym annoyed some people by not having trainers present to be helpful with pin access to get through the doors. well i got through myself, but no worker in site in the middle of the day to show me around, like changing rooms etc. then half hour later they eventually appeared.  look, the gym has lots of space for such a small gym, lots of power racks, lots of benches. yes typically there’s many young people in groups stood around taking up space whilst on their phones doing nothing. but, plenty of space for everyone. but, disappointed the gym lacks for calves, hamstrings and seriously lacks for back.  anyway, my issue was i put my bag down right near me on second floor (as couldn’t access these mystical changing rooms cause no one was around) and minutes later i noticed my bag had gone. i reported this to a young blonde female worker who clearly wasn’t listening or respecting what i was saying as i repeated myself multiple times. i said to her that i think a cleaner took the bag. her response was we don’t have cleaners today. she then asked what was in your bag, i told her clothing, gym stuff, nothing valuable but i want it back. she then said she thinks the cleaner took it. erm, she just lied by telling me there’s no cleaner today now it’s the cleaners fault.. hmm then she proceeded to walk straight to the bin at the back and pulled my bag out (as if by magic) then walked off and said it’s because i left it on the locker bench. what right near me? out the way? that’s not the point anyway you don’t take other peoples stuff and if you do put it in a safe place don’t stick it in the bin! and don’t lie to me about the cleaner. lol.  then, as she disappeared, i turned around and noticed the my drinks bottle i’d put down on the same bench just to take my bag back off her had also gone. the blonde gym worker was the only person who walked past it!  now this is a bottle and some clothing. but that’s not my problem here! utterly out of order. not only did i repeat myself, have to insist the bag is found because she wasn’t going to do anything, have her lie to me, see my bag stuffed in a bin, have no professional apology, but she wasn’t attentive and didn’t take ownership for the fact it was actually her that did those things. if that was your belongings how would you feel? lol. wow.  i watched on as a few more people struggled to get through the door and the workers were slow to react. (which puts people off don’t ya know)  i’ll re review next time and expect a better approach and experience. and an apology! bet i don’t get one!"
1,2023-05-13,I've never known any other company…,"ive never known any other company which is unable to de-activate your membership. greedy & unpleasant customer service.  i tried to de-activate a while back but their website was not working. i emailed instead, and nothing happened. a month later ive followed up and ive been told not only do i have to do it myself (by cancelling my direct debit) but that they will ignore my previous email asking to de-activate and therefore wont refund me and i have to pay for the next month. disgrace."

1,2023-05-13,Studio far too small so limited spaces…,studio far too small so limited spaces available for classes. i am paying extra for 2 weeks in advance booking and look exactly 2 weeks before but often spaces all gone.also on leaflet posted through door there was a picture of a spin class however no spin studio on site. there is a need for a bigger studio or a second one in the larger weights area next to current studio which is often unused. as a result the amount variety and access to classes is very poor compared to bedford where i was a previous member
5,2023-05-13,Great gym,"i’ve been going to this gym for a few years and although it can be busy like any gym, i find the staff helpful and welcoming which is one of the main reasons i’ve never considered leaving for another gym. bethany and curtis’ classes are inclusive and have really built my confidence in the gym."
5,2023-05-13,Impressed!!,really impressed with the new gym and the new investment in equipment. the staff do a great job and glad its 24/7 as i like to train really early in the morning. only little thing i would love to see is the option of having cold water in the showers as i have cold showers but apart from that is a 10/10 from me

3,2023-05-11,Management not as good as their gyms.,moved to new office in london with puregym almost next door and took up multi gym membership as adverts and flyers claimed another one opens in days in my local town only to find out opening is not till sept 2023 at earliest but they are still taking peoples money. then my london gym closed for weeks due to problems. the actual gyms and equipment are good for price and better laid out than a lot of their peers and staff on the ground are great but senior/middle management could do with sorting themselves out.

5,2023-05-09,Super helpful staff,the manager was very encouraging during class and helped everyone. i’m a type one diabetic and he ran to get me a lucozade when my sugar level dropped! he also messaged me after the session to check i was doing ok! this is a lovely gym to work out in!

2,2023-05-11,Terrible. No weighing machine,i am giving a low star count for the hunslet pur gym as i have been training for just over 7 weeks now and the weighing machine was out of order when i first joined so i couldnt weigh myself to keep track of progress as many would want to do. and 7 weeks on it still hasnt been fixed.it seems to me like pure gym dont actually care about providing a full fitness experience.  they just want your money.. i will be switching to another gym as i would like to monitor my weight as that was a main reason for me getting into training.

4,2023-05-12,Good budget gym,"good gym, clean and can usually get any machine or equipment.  some machine pads srarting to rip and wear."
1,2023-05-12,Small improvements for the safety of members needed,"unfortunately it could be the better pure gym of norwich, but when working out in the functional fitness area there is a distinct lack of weights. there is only bumpers so even if no one else is in there using plates you can’t load more than 200kg on a bar without it being unsafe due to the lack of room on the bar and weak collars or the need to carry normal plates across the gym . the spread of the bumpers creates a bend in the bar which is not safe and will also damage equipment. i have spoken to a member of staff about a real need for normal gym plates in the functional area instead of just near the machines. the remark was there’s nothing i can do, not even offering to speak to senior management .  unfortunately this does mean beyond an entry level of strength the gym isn’t really safe. this could be easily improved. generally the functional fitness/rig area could do with more plates and collars which don’t move."

4,2023-05-11,Avoid rush hour,big friendly place. too popular at rush hour
3,2023-05-10,Don't expect much,"the gym has quite a food spread of equipment and its mostly a friendly place. however it is extremely busy waiting for equipment is not uncommon and tou must be prepared to have alternative excercises or you would be there for hours. also some key and popular equipment is lacking quantity. as in 1 bench press rack, 1 seated row machine, 1 bar pull down rack. as i said be prepared to find alternate exercises. not always friendly. some staff will give you a smile, several wont even make eye contact and seem content leaning at the desk. none are interested in safety of gym users. i have seen users perform dangerous activity or bad form to the point of me expecting injury and not once have i seen staff intervene. lastly expect some vocal and equipment bashing meatheads. not many but they like to make themselves known.  overall just as well its a low cost. otherwise i would not tolerate it  ps a seated calf raise would be good"
4,2023-05-10,I am really enjoying PureGym,"i am really enjoying puregym, but when there are no staff there, the music doesnt play in the back ground, i dont wear earphones, because my young niece comes to the gym with me, so i like to be alert for her, i just wish the background music would be playing every time."
4,2023-05-11,"Great classes and really friendly gym, but cleanliness could be improved","i like the classes - there are lots on offer, the instructors are good, and the availability and timetable are great. the gym is very reasonably priced so i think it is good value for money. it is a very friendly and inclusive gym. the thing which can be improved is cleanliness: there are no longer any anti-bacterial wipes or spray, and the changing rooms are often quite unhygienic, especially the showers. there is quite a lot of hair in the shower and other dirt in the changing rooms which i think could be improved."

3,2023-05-11,Hot and stinking,"please can you sort out the air con.  it absolutely stinks of sweat in the andover gym.  it is so hot and stuffy that you get a sweat on even before the class starts  let alone breathing in what germs are floating around in the stale air. asking staff at the gym, all they say is its on and controlled by head office.  well having been a member since it opened it is not working as it should. please remember that there are some of us who suffer from asthma or other breathing issues, anxiety and as such a stuffy stale smelly environment in which to workout does not help."
1,2023-05-08,The plus membership does not give you…,"the plus membership does not give you access to all the other puregyms branches. even though they are all called plus membership there are different tiers and does not guarantee access to all the different gyms. i tried to go to ""higher tier puregym"" and there were at least 3 other people who were confused about why they cannot access the gym. i had a chat about it with them and they fully realise and understand the problem but they are not going to do anything about it."

3,2023-05-11,"Good value but a bit dated, dull & uninviting","i like that the gyms are easy to access and that you can come in and crack on easily. however the 2 gyms i tried were both a bit dated and the atmosphere in one of them was quite dull and felt dirty. although this was after 8:30pm in the evening on both occasions, i think its because the environment of the gyms were generally quite cold and unloved compared to other competitor gym chains ive used which have nicer lighting and newer facilities so feel more warm and inviting even during unstaffed hours."

2,2023-05-11,Kids belong in millhouses park not the gym!,i’ve been a member of this pure gym for over 4 years but in the last year or so it’s become full of kids who barely look like they could be 16. i’m sick to death of coming to the gym to not be able to use the kit i want because there’s gangs of children using them and they just take the p*** with it. they have no gym etiquette and quite honestly it’s making me consider moving gyms now because i’m so over it. it’s a shame because otherwise it’s a great gym and in all fairness this isn’t something easily controllable but i hope that puregym do something because they’re going to lose custom. i’ve heard other gym members complaining about the same issue. please think of something!
3,2023-05-11,"Good equipment, clean showers let down by poor WiFi and dirty floors","the gym is spacious with plenty of equipment to use and i noticed people cleaning them after use. the temperature was just right and the showers clean. however, on the downside, the floor was absolutely dirty, looks like it hadnt been cleaned in days. the changing room floor was the same - dirty. furthermore, the wifi is very poor - wouldnt connect."
5,2023-05-10,"I’m not a gym person, but…","i’m not a gym person. or i wasn’t a gym person. i preferred to do my exercise outdoors. but raheem is on another level.  the support, the confidence in my ability, and the encouragement to increase the weight/reps/speed/duration, when i will swear blind that ‘i can’t do it’ is next level.  my gym sessions with raheem (rabz fit) at pure gym sydenham now complement my outdoor runs (and have made them far better!). i seriously wouldn’t have it any other way. the man is a living legend."
5,2023-05-11,Everything you need in a gym!,"i mainly attend the workout classes as i am short on time and prefer the ease of following instructors. ive been going for 2 and half months and can see and feel a difference in my muscle tone! special shout out to deepa goswami - she is my favourite instructor! she explains the exercises really well and i always leave her classes feeling fabulous. she is knowledgeable and willing to share her expertise, confident, smiley and down to earth - a rare combination! she genuinely seems to care about her class which is refreshing and motivating too!"

4,2023-05-11,Great gym - Few bits needed to be perfect,"great gym, staff all great - just what the town needed! i train every morning (mon-fri) and a few additional items of kit and an extra shower would make it a solid 5/5 - the functional area could really do with a track/sled and also a tyre which would make it a “proper” functional area…and the extra shower for early morning when most people train and shower before work, there’s regularly a queue which isn’t ideal when you’re wanting to get away on time. aside of that - staff super friendly and gym is spotless so can’t fault it 👍🏼"
2,2023-05-11,I don't appreciate coming out of the…,i dont appreciate coming out of the shower in a womens changing room and a male member of staff walking in to check the changing room - when theres a woman member of staff also working in the gym and therefore capable to come and check the changing room herself!  it is very unnerving when you dont know if a mans going to walk in to the changing room at any moment.  i cant get my head around the fact and it always happens!!!!!

2,2023-05-07,Disappointed with the Catford branch,"one star ⭐ for the friendliness and professionalism of most of the staff. one star ⭐ for the classes i attend because those instructors are just brilliant. no star for the cleanliness of the entire gym, including changing rooms, toilets and showers. the only time the changing rooms are clean is around 10-11am on week days as i can see a cleaner working. no star for lacking the disinfectants and paper towels for wiping an equipment after workout. no star for the ac in the changing rooms not working as a heater during cold months or cold days. no star for resetting a shower temperature to cool (summer-warm) and reducing the time of running water to half of the time (approx.7sec before it turns itself off) since the british summer time in march despite there was no sign of warmer weather. i was told by the managers that they couldnt do anything about it as it is a puregym scheme trial in all gyms and that i can contact the company myself, but with no specific contact details provided. to me it looks more like saving on energy bills for obvious to all of us reasons! (im sure this shower temperature changes are not listed in the ""terms and conditions""). i joined the gym shortly after it was newly open but if there will be no changes to my ""no star"" reasons in near future, i will reconsider to join somewhere else where i feel comfortable, cold free and my money is well spent for. what is the point to get fitter when my health is jeopardised by catching a frequent cold from using no warm showers, being surrounded by dust mites or catching germs from an undisinfected equipment. well, what wont kill you, will make you stronger would not quite apply here."

3,2023-05-06,Distinctly Average,good selection of good quality kit. some members need some lessons in gym etiquette and some members are clearly not 16 or over and mess around when youre trying to train. showers are dirty and the cleaner in the gents often sits on his phone in the changing rooms.
4,2023-05-07,Excellent pump class but dirty toilets and cold water in the showers!,"i recently attended an excellent pump class that left me feeling strong and accomplished, but unfortunately, the dirty toilets and cold showers detracted from the overall experience.  the class itself was led by a skilled and motivating instructor who pushed us to challenge our limits and achieve our fitness goals. i appreciated the variety of exercises and the emphasis on building lean muscle and burning fat. however, i was disappointed to find that the toilets were not clean and well-maintained, which made the overall gym experience unpleasant.  additionally, the cold showers were a letdown after such a challenging workout. i understand that facilities can sometimes have maintenance issues, but it would have been great to have warm water to help soothe and relax my muscles after the intense workout.  despite the cleanliness and shower issues, i still enjoyed the pump class and would recommend it to others who are looking for a challenging and effective workout. i hope that the gym can address the cleanliness and maintenance issues to create a more enjoyable experience for all members."

3,2023-05-03,Overcrowded and water bottles,"been going for a while now and i  love the gym itself but has gone slightly down hill recently. the women’s toilets are nasty. they’re dirty enough but then women leave empty water bottles in there after washing themselves which i understand for religious reasons but leaving the water bottles in there is unhygienic. they need a sign in the toilets that says “ please don’t leave your empty bottles in the toilets”.  could also probably do with lowering the limit of how many people can enter at a time as it just becomes a social club for strange men that  end up way too close to you as they stand around equipment conversating and stare at the women. the equipment itself is great and all placed in good areas, the gym is a good size and the staff have always been super friendly and helpful but the atmosphere and hygiene could be better."

1,2023-05-05,Cold showers !,"i have been a member of puregym sutton coldfield from when they opened the temperature of the showers is tepid warm at best plus there are only 2 supposed hot showers and 2 cold showers which never get used so at busy times we are queuing to get a shower i mentioned this to them and they said it will be staying at that temperature a lot of the members i know are not happy with this we dont expect to have a more or less cold shower after a workout unless this changes me and a few other members will be leaving its not good enough so unless you like a cold shower dont join this gym as they are not interested in looking after you ,very poor"

5,2023-05-04,100% top notch,"there isnt really anything bad at all, it was my first time going to the gym, and i really enjoyed it.  they have good facilities, good hygiene, lots of space and a plethora of work outs to do."
1,2023-05-04,Not Pure Gym - It's Pure Zoo.....,"just joined after cancelling a month ago as there was an offer of £0.00 joining fee and half price for the 1st month.  having visited this evening, i will definitely be cancelling the membership as the gym has now turned into a zoo... too many members using peak and off-peak. the gym smells of bo everywhere, theres no cleaning equipment, ac is almost always turned off, wifi needs verification every time you need access (last thing you need when working out).  this place has gone completely down hill.  i have better standards and will be looking elsewhere! perhaps the smelly teenagers can thrive in an overcrowded, unsafe environment to save a few pennies."
1,2023-05-04,Do not visit this gym,"honestly would not visit this gym, the smell is so bad i thought i was going to be sick i actually contemplated leaving my workout. pure gym are obviously aware due to the number of plug in air fresheners dotted about. also if you’re a women stick to the women’s area if you want to workout without being hit on or stared at"

1,2023-05-01,I joined this gym in 2018 for my…,"i joined this gym in 2018 for my physical and mental health. it was brilliant when i first joined and was there for years, until recently. a gym is supposed to be a safe space for people to go who need to focus on their health and mental well-being when life takes a toll on them. i am so disgusted and appalled to say what has been going on in my local puregym. i will personally not recommend it to anyone. it has been managed without a doubt disgustingly, with people who have their own agendas with either staff and members at the gym. 0 stars if i could."
1,2023-05-04,Reducing showers - not good,"staff and facilities are great, however the decision to close some of the showers for environmental reasons is madness i understand this is a head office decision. queueing for over 10 mins after a class to wait for a shower is not acceptable, users are queueing in their gym gear which means they spend more time in there, i understand staff check showers regularly but cant clean them well because they are always in use, so they are often dirty. closing 2 of the 5 the showers will not negate the need for people to use them, and i can only assume that the decision to turn the water temperature down is in the hope that people spend less time in them! whilst i applaud the sentiment you are severely frustrating your valued members. please reverse this decision!"
1,2023-05-03,Tragic.The gym was ok until last week,"tragic.the gym was ok until last week. they changed and replaced some machines for new ones, with cheap finishing which not doing the ""job""as previous ones and some of them already broken and out of service. congrats! some of machines not even been replaced but there some brand new which no one want to use as they really unnecessary . i think there must be someone in heat office making this ""glorious "" decisions but in real life probably never been at gym and not really understand peoples needs . instead of that changing room, mens shower and toilets in tragic shape and thats the main place which need serious work asap. constantly leaking urinals and terrible smell all over the changing rooms , thats what you will experience most of the times. this is ongoing problem there and no one cares . i thought in this days every company wants to gain new customers , members- pure gym doing opposite -with that unnecessary changes they made me leave and also couple more customers with me as they were unhappy of ignorance and cheap changes made . that was a nice place some time ago . i remember well as was also member of soho gum there before . however me and 4 more colleagues just signed off and we have new place where customer service listen peoples needs . congratulations of fantastic ideas ! shame they not that what really need to be done there !"

4,2023-05-04,Recommend gay as PT,have pt sessions with gary. he’s so good and upbeat. i’ve benefitted from his sessions. men’s toilets smell a bit “cheesey” which could do with some pads in the urinals and that would make a difference to the smell.

3,2023-05-02,Gym's standards have declined,"i have been a member of this gym since 2017 and over the past year i have noticed a decline at this location ranging from broken equipment, to cleanliness: - broken machines take a long time to be fixed (laying leg curl machine has been out of action for at least 2 months), which can be frustrating as you can be wafting a long time to use some equipment. - resistance bikes have broken/loose adjusters, treadmills out of order - small things like carabiners are hard find (i have taken to bringing my own). - the sports water machine frequently has a fault stopping you from using it. - the personal trainers can be frustrating, when training clients i have seen some stood chatting to another trainer while the client is sat on the machine with their phone. i understand they may take longer, but taking up a machine for 15 minutes and only exercising for 5 minutes and not interacting for the other 10 is a waste, especially at busy times. my last visit was extended by about 30 minutes in total because of waiting for equipment to become available. - the male changing room showers facilities need attention, at least 3 showers are out of order and one of the working ones only produces cold water, not to mention the smell of backed up sewage. (cannot speak for the female facilities)  it is clear that they are trying to cut costs where they can, but now this is impacting the quality of the gym. paying the premium membership is not really worth it any more in my opinion as you dont get what you pay for anymore."
1,2023-05-04,I would give 0 if I could….,"i would give 0 if i could.fully paid membership every month, yet in april an extra £12.99 was taken from my account without authorisation after paying the membership in full via direct debit.to top it my gym membership got suspended…can’t make this crap up right??!oh and none existent customer service only bots so can’t get any answers or my money back nor accessing to the gym…an utter joke!! spend your money elsewhere"

1,2023-04-20,No Frills gym just don't expect it to…,"no frills gym just dont expect it to be clean! gym does all the basics of a gym with cheap running machines. free weights are excellent with good space but everything else is basics, cheap and not worth the money. only ever seen 1 member of staff when training and that was my first attendance at the gym. sadly no cleaning products available and when asked about this on twitter and via email response was due to saving the world with less paper towels but dont worry we clean when and if we feel like it. so im sweating like a pig on a running machine and i cant clean it for the next person or vice versa. ive gone to go on a machine seen it was drenched in someones sweat but i cant clean it as there is 0 cleaning products. im pretty sure if they want to save the work with paper they could atleast leave cleaning spray and change towels regularly. i find it odd that we had covid and become clean again to then go back to being dirty slobs (not the people, every person says the same thing) this is by far the dirtiest gym ive attended to in caerphilly and theres quite a few gyms and they all have cleaning products apart from this gym."

5,2023-05-01,"Good budget gym, clean, friendly and good range of classes","puregym is one of the budget gym chains which survived into the post covid-19 era.  flexible modern memberships available for single or multi-gym access at reasonable rates.kit at the blyth gym works as expected being brand new (q1 2023), and while the gym gets busy, the app lets you plan your best visiting times.  if youre a class person, there are a range of classes available from staff and freelance instructors which are safe and effective.  pts are around during staffed hours but had no experience of their knowledge, safety or coaching skills. changing rooms (as youd expect new) are basic, clean and in good condition, with padlocks needed for lockers if you opt to use them.  my only negative is that the showers are set so hot they practically burn and you end up sweating more after a shower than when you started.  team: turn the temp down - they would still be hot enough and the club would be more eco-friendly and save more on energy use!"

3,2023-05-01,3 out of 5,"3/5 stars. the gym is good value for money, that being said it’s at a higher price than the ashford for example. with the core membership, you’d expect access to both, however because maidstone is more expensive you are forced to pay more per month to access both gyms even with the core membership.  i wouldn’t go here after 4/5pm. but if you’re an early gym goer like myself then you won’t have any issues.  there seems to be a lot of teens, which i think is a by product of the price point. those complaining about this, need to realise the kids probably can’t afford the more expensive gyms out there.  all in all it’s an okay gym. the only big gripe is when a class is on, the music from the class is so loud you can’t here yourself think, often rendering my earphones useless, this is something those holding classes need to be more considerate about there’s no need for them to have the music so loud at all."
2,2023-04-19,"really good gym, poor customer service","the gym itself was really good and had everything you could possibly need. however, the customer service and staff were of no help. when in the gym toilets i had a member of staff talk very rudely towards me over getting mud all over the floor when it was not in fact me and i had clean shoes on. furthermore, when i contacted customer service due to breaking a bone and the website not letting me cancel my subscription, i had a response of “try the website” which was obviously very unhelpful. after sending 3 different emails on different consecutive days i finally got a reply along the lines of “please don’t email lots of different times, instead email in a chain” not sure why they couldn’t of just sent a helpful email instead of wasting time sending an email on how i shouldn’t email. anyways, customer service never helped me resolve this issue and i had to contact my bank instead who sorted the issue immediately."
5,2023-04-30,Great gym,"great gym, not too busy , lots of equipment, friendly atmosphere"
1,2023-04-20,I am gratefull for the use of the…,i am gratefull for the use of the gym..however there are individuals who appear to equate working out with the necessity to make as much noise as possible by clattering the weights against machine and ground and throwing equipent around. could you inform clients to not do these things and respect equipment and other gym goers.
3,2023-04-20,"Hot water, ventilation","no hot water for weeks, and it needs more improvement on ventilation."
4,2023-04-30,Working out at puregym,i enjoyed working out at puregym. theres an availability of equipments and also theres a variety to choose from. the fitness classes are excellent and the atmosphere is very clean.

5,2023-04-30,Recommend,"excellent quality if equipment. reasonable price (bear in mind, im cheap😂😂). didnt see any staff on the floor tough, didnt bother me but something to consider if you are new and need help with using the equipment. i love the app, lots of workouts available from day 1 without having to pat extra. all in all, not bad."
5,2023-04-19,It’s great social place for young…,it’s great social place for young people and has been a total godsend for my daughter. thankyou pure gym.
2,2023-04-20,This gym is 4 floors underground,"this gym is 4 floors underground. i took advantage of the 3 day pass in january, (unfortunately they are not 24 hours so when i signed up just before midnight id already lost a day) i then signed up for another month cancelling after this as i found the atmosphere very weird and a number of staff seemed to be obsessed with my activities and whereabouts. i couldnt use my pin at the front entrance, which i think was done on purpose so i could give the staff something to do. it too weeks to rectify this, the tanoy system was sometimes put on very loud, which was quite offputting if you were ""getting in the zone"" music was controlled by staff seemingly so either on the treadmill or the mat. it is a very big gym, and with the membership price being the lowest on the market you really have to push through (being of a shyier nature) just to get past (some of)the staff. generally other gym goers are very respectful, keep themselves to themselves and the gym is big enough for there always to be a space for what you want to do, but i get the impression staff have to like you for you to be allowed to do what you want to do.  i then restarted my membership, for half the price, and no joining fee, and then paid for another month. for the last week i have been purchasing day passes until friday there was a leak and so it was a bit of a waste of money as the gym was closed because a massive section of the floor was completely flooded of sewage water into the female changing room and a section by the running machines. why this wasnt closed prior to 6pm or shortly after when id arrived i do not know - clearly it had not just started. i recieved an email at 10pm - 3 and a half hours after purchasing my day pass, 2 hours after being thrown out the gym, that it would work at other pure gyms unfortunately by 3pm the next day this feature was taken off.  the cleaner i met when i first joined was quite bolshy in the changing room, she was later hovering by the running machines, there are probably a few, generally the changing room toilets were always very dirty, i often saw toilet rolls were just left on the floor - whether you are a personal trainer of a cleaner, - i dont think they are cleaned regularly, but if you are working for an establishment at least take some pride in the facillities which are a)paying your wages b)being used by paying clients showers are clean but this is more from them not being used than anything else lots of the lockers in the female changing room are either broken, nearly broken or used without a lock, so when you are rushing and trying to find a space to put your stuff - good luck! i went into the mens on friday after arriving and the females being pretty much out of order, and they are far cleaner, bigger and of a general better condition. it is student led and i think the staff are comfortable with this. being from a dancing/fitness/performing back ground i really have to work hard in the gym and i also like to keep myself to myself i have found the staffs obsession with what i am doing both off putting and upsetting. there are 4 gyms in liverpool (puregyms) but as this is right in the centre by both liverpool lime street and central it is very easy to get to. i also kept initially getting my timings wrong, and instead of a member of staff just saying oh off peak is from 1.30, (i went at 1 one day) i really had to go into the app / website - the pods are tiny, its a struggle to fit in if you have a rucksack on your back, also if you are a bit claustrophobic but after being rejected access through the main door i got used to these pods- when my code actually worked. i think some staff have to remember they work for puregym, (and not the other way around) - unprofessional, uncooperative and lazy pts"
2,2023-04-29,Once you get in the gym and start using…,"once you get in the gym and start using the equipment, your frustration levels are easily settled (maybe due to physical exercises) and you can acknowledge that this gym (pure gym london borough) is a decent average gym. actually getting there (and literally into the gym) is a challenging but rather annoying hurdle one must overcome. this gym is often unstaffed, that means: no one at reception, no one answering your phone calls or messages. you cannot get basic information from the generic website. the lack of staff can make this an affordably cheap gym, but perhaps human support would be worth the extra penny. and bring a bloody lock for your locker as there is absolutely no information about this on their site. all in all, after my initial experience the good quality of the gym equipment is an undeniably strong plus."
5,2023-04-29,The convenience and simplicity of access to the gym,"after a long break, i decided to rejoin the gym. i was excited to learn that a new puregym was opening in my neighborhood; the fact that it was only a two-minute walk from my house bolstered my motivation. so i signed up online, and it was incredibly simple to do so. the app was also quite useful, with a lot of extras like workouts and instructions on how to utilize the gym facilities.  the gym is nice, and for the fee, you get everything you need to accomplish any workout. i havent tried any classes yet, so i cant comment on those.  the fact that i may use the gym 24/7 is important to me because it is tough to establish a decent pattern for my weekly workouts owing to work commitments. i also dont enjoy peak hours; i prefer it when its calm and peaceful, and puregym accommodates my requirements.  so far, i am pleased."
4,2023-04-30,Bad showers,the 24/7 system is the best but the shower facility is bad it stop working again at one point they say it was the demand over the period were people was showering to save money but after it was fixed it was good but short live this sunday morning just a few people and the shower was broken again.

3,2023-04-29,Pure Gym Lambeth,"i like the gym as ive been using it for exactly 10 years,since its opened!i think it says a lot... ive seen plenty of managers and pts there and i accept we are all different. however,i do not understand why something needs to be changed what obviously worked really well for the members! specifically im talking about changing the timetable!we/members after a long day at work try to fit in classes we like or prefer and it has been brilliant in the past couple of months but now it looks like will be changed from next week. i know im not the only one,so probably more feedback on the way from others but i just want to express how disappointed i feel! i love the evening circuits classes, especially owens!his classes,the vibe,the intensity and himself just truly brilliant!!need more pts like him! unfortunately,from next week it looks like no more circuit on thursday and the tuesday one seemed to be shortened for some reason! i can only use the gym on those days and to be honest i specifically joined those circuits but i just feel put down and disappointed,as it wont happen any more on thursday and the tuesday is only 30mins:( can i ask what is the reason?? once again ive been using pure gym lambeth since it has opened!!!"

2,2023-04-28,Pure Gym Wincheap is an increasing…,"pure gym wincheap is an increasing disappointment and i have been a member for several years. class timetable is virtually non existent, the equipment is tired and decidedly dirty, the environment is similarly unsanitary and the staff are basically in a rotating door. the new staff are virtual children and have little experience and no expertise in social skills, let alone teaching skills. this can mean that health and safety is an issue, as the necessary checks, demonstrations and correction of how to use equipment etc is not happening. the staff spend most of their time looking at their phones, even while running classes and virtually have no engagement with the customers at all. the model employed by pure gym does not work. as the instruction teams are quickly [mostly virtually] trained in a short time frame, thrown in to a site, they have no experience and little confidence, are desperate to get enough pt sessions [of which there are not enough to make it viable for most of them] and therefore they very quickly end up leaving. management is often poor and the sites are often neglected; dirty changing rooms, overflowing sanitary bins, lack of cleaning equipment, no toilet rolls … despite raising concerns over and over again and even meeting twice with regional management …. it is the same old story. once kingsmead reopens in their updated and upgraded building .. i will be returning there. by the way, several other members [and exiting staff] share the same, if not more scathing views of both the system and the club. really a poor choice, if you are considering joining."

4,2023-04-29,Great Gym,"i like going to puregym as theres no fuss, easy to sign up then turn up as and when you can. the piped music can be a bit loud at times as a lot of people like to listen to there own choice, me included. i did ask a member of staff how to get the matrix bike to display my heart rate, the person didnt know which wasnt very helpful. a little training required there. overall i do like going to puregym as theres a wide range of equipment ot use and its open 24/7."

5,2023-04-28,Always pleased,"ive been a member of puregym for a number of years & of the marsh mills site since it opened. its always been clean, a good space to work in with nice kit. puregym membership has been fantastic for me, using classes on their app, 24 hour access, regularly using other puregym sites when visiting friends & family, and all for a great low price, so its great value. im moving off the mainland uk shortly and im really sad that i wont have a puregym!!"

3,2023-04-27,Great Zumba®  Class at PureGym TCR,"great zumba® class at puregym tottenham court road last night with becky crawford.  after having been with puregym piccadilly since 2016 i have now cancelled my membership, due to the class timetable being dreadful.  at one point the cycle classes were at 7am monday to friday and now they are at 6:15pm monday to friday. not all members want to do a cycle class 5 days a week.  would have been great if the zumba®, dance, and yoga classes were not going to be charged at £4 per class, meaning this has taking these classes off the timetable due to cost and lack of attendance.  it would be nice if the gym would schedule their class timetable around those who enjoy attending them.  i appreciate the country is currently in a cost of living and energy crisis affecting business and having to make cut backs, my loyalty is now with the gym group, as they are providing a better service at this time and have been attending classes with them since february 2023 when i joined.  the gym group class timetables are scheduled at the right times across a number of branches and also saving myself £7 month."

5,2023-04-28,Gold Standard Staff,"its a small box gym, which normally would lead me to minus points but i just cant because the staff more than make up for the size.  i just had the induction today with mark. have had many inductions over the years but todays was hands down the best i have ever experienced. waay beyond the usual ""here are the toilets, now buy my package"" induction ive had in other places, mark took the time to show exact optimal placement of the pads for each set of equipment. he not only demonstrated, but also got each inductee to have a go, so he could give pointers that ensured they would get the best from each piece of equipment.  it is thoroughly clear he knows his stuff and is generous with sharing his knowledge. he even went back to check on inductees who decided to use the gym after, which was a really nice touch.  the atmosphere at the gym is awesome. for us oldies i can best describe it by saying it reminds me of the family feeling in the awesome gym from 90s comedy ""dodgeball.""  whoever is in charge has built and maintained a great team at hereford. you can tell all the trainers enjoy being there and working together. while i was there the trainers made a point to greet or exchange a few words with every single customer - and not in that creepy ""fitness first style way, but in a genuinely warm and friendly manner.  there is an almost tangible positive energy that flows directly from the coaches and straight onto the gym floor. this makes newbies feel warm and welcomed and cuts through all self-consciousness.  hats off to the hereford team. i have had a fair few different gym experiences in my time but cannot remember the last time i was so impressed by the atmosphere and energy that the staff bring to the workout space."

3,2023-04-20,Overall Good Experience,"this pure gym is quite small but offers a lot of cardio machines: bikes, treadmills , cross trainers… they have the whole second floor dedicated to it! however the gym is quite small so there is only 1 of each machine such as a smith machine so when it is busy it is hard to get on equipment. the machines are good and all work well and are looked after as you see staff cleaning them and putting equipment away. however, there is a lack of variety in the machines compared to other pure gyms as there is no : hack squat, t row, hip thrust machine….unfortunately the lift has been broken for weeks even months… and there doesn’t seem to be any fixtures any time soon. this obviously limits disabled members or members with additional needs which acts as a barrier to the disabled community . furthermore, it proposes risks if someone was to get into danger on the top floor.the toilets are mostly clean with air fresheners but do have quite a stench… it might be the confined space but a regular clean would be appropriate to prevent this. the gym has a good atmosphere and most instructors seem welcoming however a “hello” or a smile would be nice! the changing rooms are clean and there is help buttons available which is comforting."

2,2023-04-20,Air conditioning & hygiene is not good,"air conditioning is not good , the gym always smells bad and the toilets always smell bad. also the seats of the women toilets are all wobbly for months but no-one seems to bother there is no clean station upstairs , so the one disinfectant spray bottle always runs out and it doesnt get replaced for hours. not being able to apply our hygiene before and after using equipment although its basic and absolutely necessary,  it is not supported sadly.location is bath."

3,2023-04-25,Needs a refit badly,"although this is a large and well equipped gym, much of the equipment is old, some remains out of order for weeks and that which works like cross trainers for example all need a service. the wifi is patchy with areas with no coverage. it gets worse in the changing rooms where the showers are cold, lockers broken, blocked urinals and all very dirty."
4,2023-04-25,Low cost gym offering premium services,at finsbury park pure gym is always improving but one drawback is that the equipment on the top floor is too close to one another otherwise everything it is  great place to train.

2,2023-04-25,Riverside <<< Castle Mall,"i have been going to castle mall’s puregym since early 2020. the gym there is absolutely fantastic, excellent atmosphere, high-quality equipment and people.  as a very happy customer i decided to add a secondary gym to my subscription as the one in riverside is now closer to where i work.  unfortunately to my surprise all the machines (cables-pulleys) are of a different brand than the ones in castle mall. older, of lesser quality and with heavier weights. now, this isn’t the end of the world and i know that different brands have distinct mechanisms/angles/calibrations making them feel different. however, when i subscribe to another puregym i expect the same level of equipment and quality, not a downgrade.  this probably happens in a lot of other puregyms across the uk, and some people might not mind it, but for me it really throws off my routine and makes it hard to focus on improvement. what’s the point of paying for a +1 access when i have to change my whole workout schedule/weights as the machines feel like they belong to a complete different gym chain.  i think it would be beneficial if puregym could provide a more consistent experience across all its locations. that way, i can rely on the same weights and machines, and i can focus on improving my shape instead of wasting time trying to adapt to different equipment.  i honestly feel torn to write this dissatisfying review as i will happily remain a pure gym customer, however i will not visit again nor recommend the one in riverside over the one in castle mall. especially to someone like me who wants to use both/switch."
5,2023-04-25,Always Fantastic😊,the classes are amazing 😊 instructors are fabulous 😊
1,2023-04-25,Worst Puregym I've visited in MCR,"after 5 years as a puregym member, this is the third puregym im a member of and by miles the worst one. ive been here for a good few weeks and apart from in classes (that are ran on the middle of the floors as there are no studios), im yet to see a staff member. the gym and the equipment is outdated and doesnt allow for much flexibility or variation in your workouts. no kettlebells, no slam balls, no prowler sled, no room to do weighted walked lunges or barbell hip thrusts, no skiing machine and whoever planned the layout of this gym did not think it through at all. you cant bring weights around so if you want to do weights, youll be crammed into a tiny space downstairs where theres about 5 benches as theyve decided to cover the top floor with cardio equipment and make it lool like theyre still practicing social distancing - the use of space is that poorly planned. even if its cheaper than both market street and exchange quay which i have previously been a member of, its not good value for money like the other 2. market street feels smaller but its much better equipped and always has staff around. i went for this one as ive always been very happy at puregym but will now look elsewhere in stretford as this gym is so limited. i like to do my own circuit training and combine weights and cardio but its not possible here. its weights downstairs and cardio upstairs. very poorly planned with little innovation. its old school and doesnt have the best room for a fun workouts."

2,2023-04-17,Too many people on phones not working out taking up space,"pure gym is cheap and there are branches everywhere. this is the positive.the negative: having been to leeds, liverpool, twickenham, reading, and a few more there is one consistency: poor maintenance, and poor ventilation.  i am also fed up with people coming to the gym with a tripod to not work out but to flex on social media. this isnt policed, and the staff dont care. i do as its not legal to film without consent and when someone is pretending to lift, and filming me actually sweating, it gets on my nerves.  i have mentioned it to managers but they did not know that it is in fact illegal. pure gym, its time to educate staff, and kids who go to the gym to watch youtube on the bench should get a new hobby."
1,2023-04-19,Awful Hygiene and Overcrowded,"this gym is really smelly, always overcrowded, there is always something or the other that’s broken or non functional. the washrooms are right in front of people working out it’s so unpleasant. i wouldn’t recommend to anyone, the hygiene of this gym is really poor."

4,2023-04-20,Lovely gym,"lovely gym, i’ve always felt comfortable working out here. i haven’t given a 5 star because they don’t have many of the popular machines so you often find people standing around waiting to have a go. the showers are not always 100% clean either even though i’ve seen the cleaner there on days i’ve been at the gym. wished i had more free time to attend the gym as i’d come more frequently"
5,2023-04-20,"Basic, but well equipped and clean","been a user of pure gym for past 12 years. although the price jumped up a bit higher than i’d like, gyms are great. basic but clean, well equipped and accessible at any time that suits me."
1,2023-04-20,Not great...,"there was always some sort of construction going on which meant half of the facilities in the gym were unusable e.g., the toilet. equipment has to be over 15 years old, rusty, cranky and honestly just feels unsafe to use. only positive i can think of is that its open 24/7 other than that its always absolutely packed, full of children which last time i checked i didnt think you could go to the gym until a certain age but hey ho."

4,2023-04-19,Need cleaning stations on gym floor.,"a good range of equipment; i enjoy the classes, and the staff are friendly.  due to cleaning stations only being located in the studios, members do not clean down the equipment after usage (out of sight, out of mind). head office wants to avoid cleaning stations on the gym floor. this is standard gym etiquette, and cleanliness should be at the forefront."

2,2023-04-20,Bad idea …,"loved that we were getting new equipment finally as the old stuff was very tired at best, but the new layout is impossible. all the cardio stuff now upstairs, in a low ceiling area with little to no aircon. new treadmills don’t have fans so compounds this. the only part with a high ceiling is where the big glass segment is, and was already a heat trap in summer months, but at least before we had a choice of up or downstairs. walking up the stairs last week felt like getting off a plane on holiday, you could literally feel them temp change. seriously considering reviewing membership, can’t work that way, hot, stuffy & no air, not good for an asthmatic, in fact not sure good for anyone. whoever thought it was a great idea, i challenge you to try it yourself!"

5,2023-04-21,My thoughts about PureGym,"puregym offers a wide range of exercise experiences. i can do my classes online, in branch, with or without a trainer, who i must say offer exceptional classes. the place is spacious, clean and well ventilated."

4,2023-04-20,Morning silence,i run hotels and we find that not having piped music at breakfast time gives guests time to enjoy some silence at the beginning of the day and is much appreciated.  given the choice of music in puregym at 5am this is something that you should seriously consider and trial.

2,2023-04-20,Too packed,"many lockers are broken, only a few sets of each weight, the waiting time for each equipment is too long, the sanitizers arent supplied regularly, and the free weights section is always packed. in contrast, the cardio section is always free, even in peak times. it doesnt fit the obvious demand. very disappointed."

3,2023-04-20,Great gym and people and love training…,great gym and people and love training here. but honestly the males loos need to be maintained i can barley stand using them at times. today one toilet was blocked and stuffed with tissue and a brush shoved and left in there. with the worst smell. the urinals always smell horrendous. be great if it was maintained to a good standard. regards
3,2023-04-20,Not Enough Free Weights,i come to this location more because it is close to home and i generally like it however there is always an issue with the free weights section. there are guys that take like 4 sets of weights at a time and keep them. i find it difficult to find enough 12 kilo weights.  the bathroom this time was better but it generally has a strong smell in there of either chemical or sewer. i hate changing in there for that reason.

2,2023-04-20,More like a youth club than a gym,"the gym is well equipped, but unfortunately is more like a youth club than a gym.  it’s a waste of time going after 4 o’clock in the afternoon as groups of teenagers all stand around chatting and hogging equipment"

2,2023-04-24,Not 24 hours as advertised.,i have to give puregym low review because they advertise 24/h gym. but if this one is your local one then youre out luck as its not 24 hours. and hours are quite restrictive.
5,2023-04-20,Good gym,easy to use & good equipment
5,2023-04-20,"For the price, this place can’t be beat","there’s a good range of equipment, however for me it’s all about the classes. the sweat and legs, bums and tums classes are excellent (if sessions could be added for each day- it would be great). as with most gyms, you are going to get the busy/popular times but i’ve found the mornings through to early afternoon the sweet spot. best instructors (thus far) have been gomes, rhian and samera. areas for improvement- ladies toilets (drains stink); more foam rollers and stretching equipment; good to have a sports massage person visit on certain days. overall, for the price, this place is excellent."

4,2023-04-19,Good,the experience is fine and what you should expect. the cylinder doors are annoying though.
4,2023-04-20,The gym equipment is of good standard.,"the gym equipment is of good standard at most gyms, the gyms are usually very busy, you will have to be patient when using equipment. a few things i have found in multiple gyms are as follows. staff interaction is limited unless you’re taking classes. the spray bottles and blue roll is not of enough quantity or well stocked (used to clean down machinery). the water machine isn’t refilled that regularly. some equipment needs a refresh (usually grips are well warn on most items. a big issue is the lack of carabiners, having to take ones from other equipment.  otherwise you get what you pay for. cheap gym membership, very busy most of the time."
3,2023-04-21,Could have more leg machines,could have more leg  also more chest machines overall is a normal and good size gym.

3,2023-04-20,"Amazing value, good selection of equipment and classes","pros: great location with free parking, 24hr opening and exactly what a gym should be plus great value for money. dislikes, studio could have better air con as it / we get hot in there during a tough class (and its currently winter) access through the portal doors is slow, so theres often long queues, so get there early if youre going in for a class. some better class options would be nice, currently mostly all weights and tone up classes."

4,2023-04-20,Mostly great experience,"mostly great experience. only things i dont like are that a male cleaner knocked to enter the ladies changing room when i was in the shower. this unnerved and panicked me as it was only another lady saying there was someone in the shower that stopped him. if that lady hadnt been there, he would have come in. this was at bidston. also there are only 2 recumbent bikes, which is not enough as they are in constant use.  other than that everything else was fine."
2,2023-04-20,Internation bank accounts,"the problem we have is that we take long term international students but to get the discounts they need to set up a direct dept, but pure gym do not except international bank accounts so we are having to use our own account and then chase the student for the money every month. the students love the gym and the openning hours."

4,2023-04-20,Friendly and welcoming atmosphere,"really great atmosphere. whether its 11pm and theres barely 30 people or 6pm and its packed, i truly never feel judged - doesnt matter what i look like/what im wearing - and always manage to find what i want. only complaint is about the indecisive showers! although they do encourage me not to spend too long in there, which is a good thing i suppose."
5,2023-04-20,"A good, clean gym with all you need",i have been using pure gym for years and it has always been welcoming and clean. theyve recently removed a lot of the cardio machines on the first floor to create more floor space for loose weights/mats which is great and was needed. it would be good to extend the mirrors to take the extra floor space into account.

4,2023-04-20,Good overall but would be great if few preventable problems were addressed.,"excellent value for price overall. some possible improvements:  > could use more free weight area in lieu of cardio equipment which goes under-utilized meanwhile you always have to wait for strength equipment, especially at peak times. 60/40 area split towards cardio makes it more a fitness studio than a gym proper, should lean the other way. > noticed recently a lot of loose bolts and pin handles (from daily use) which staff pretty much ignores even when pointed out, should be their responsibility to make sure this stuff is tight (surely guests are not expected to bring their own wrenches/ratchets to tighten stuff)"

1,2023-04-20,I have been making regular payment to…,i have been making regular payment to pure gym for over 12 months. i suspended and re started my membership and you cancelled it. you asked me to pay for another joiners fee and you put the prices up of the gym membership. you have become so expensive. all you want is money.
3,2023-04-20,"Great gym, but disappointing classes","great gym, good range of equipment and pleasant place to workout without feeling intimidated.however classes are not so good.  i would like to see pure gym offering a range of classes for different levels of skills, age groups and life stages.  the current timetable is too exclusive and class content is limited and quite frankly boring.  not everyone wants to bulk up or create enormous glutes which seems to be the current trend.  i would love to see more mobility, cardio, stretch and pilates classes on the timetable.  its so lovely to see a mix of generations now using the gym floor, would be great to offer a timetable to recognise all of your customers.what a rubbish ""standard"" response from the gym (see below)."

4,2023-04-19,I love the classes but in need of cleaning products,"i love the classes they are brilliant, especially the cycing sessions! the only issue is we dont have any spray to wipe down the bikes... this has been going on for some time and it is not good enough for such a well established gym. bring back the blue paper and spray upstairs please!!"
5,2023-04-24,Price is good,"price is good, its helped me get fitter and stronger. can now use my motorbike and not had to change it for a smaller and lighter one.there are people of various fitness levels age and no one pesters you.  im getting older and dident notice how unfit id got glad i joined the gym well worth doing there doing cut price at the moment so not to dear to try"
1,2023-04-19,Poor standard of facilities,i do enjoy training at puregym wisbech. however: whenever there is a piece of equipment that is broken or faulty it is always out of use for several weeks. currently the sport water machine has been out of use for over 3 weeks and having paid the upgraded membership for this service i think this is unacceptable. cleanliness of the gym in general is lacking. some of the cross trainers have missing or poorly adjusted feet meaning they wobble or sit at a slight angle (or both) they have been like this since the gym reopened after covid restrictions were lifted some time ago!

2,2023-04-19,Very disappointed with the refurb at  Gloucester,"very disappointed with the refurb, after weeks of disruption, it is finally finished. there is now no obvious route to walk to get to the change rooms. you now have to negotiate around weight machines and folks waiting for the machines, not a safe environment, especially for visually impaired folk. the best cross trainer machines, with the variable footbed angle, have all been taken away and not replaced. the remaining machines that are upstairs face the wall by the entrance, creating a cramped, uncomfortable exercise experience. as has been previously mentioned, there is no privacy in the change rooms as its now open plan, and in the name of reducing energy consumption (reducing costs) the temperature of the showers has been turned down to the point that they are cold 🥶 and almost impossible to stand under after a workout. pity they didnt have a deep clean during the refurb. oh, please stop leaving the covers off the drains in the showers 🤢"

4,2023-04-17,Great facilities,"great facilities, really easy to find available equipment, all in good condition. the only comment is that in the few weeks ive been going i havent had a single conversation with a member of staff - good because sometime its good to feel anonymous and just get on with it - bad because you dont know what you dont know and sometimes its good just to know theres someone there you can ask a question of."

4,2023-04-19,This gym is generally good,"this gym is generally good, however, there is a problem with people hogging the weights equipment.  this really needs to be addressed.   for example, yesterday, i  used 3 different pieces of equipment whilst one man was occupying the same one.  by the time i left, he was still sat there messing with his phone. the other issue is cleaning.   there is a thick layer of dust on the front of the treadmills and other cardio equipment."

3,2023-04-19,Good value for money,"what works well is the gym is 24/7, there is a water machine for the advanced membership and you can go to gyms in other locations. i got a huge discount through my work so the gym is one of the cheapest with no joining fee and i earn points for each visit through my health insurance.  what it can improve on: mostly more free classes like zumba, pilates and yoga. they got rid of a few machines that i find useful such as the vibrate one for after your workout. a protein shake bar or option might be useful but hard to manage if a 24/7 gym i know"
1,2023-04-22,I am writing this review regarding jack…,"i am writing this review regarding jack the pt  ,he was my pt for almost 2 years, it was going well till the last december i stop going with him for a bit then i started again with him i call him to go back he said ok then we have a meeting of what i will like to achieve then i paid for weeks session with him , he said that he will do a plan for training and food plan i went away for 2 weeks when i was back not plan yet , i went to a session with him and he said i promise i will have the plan and everything done by next week and i said ok cool , i book a nanny cause it was half terms for my kids and he text me an hour before to cancel cause he haven’t been able to do the plan cause he been too busy with this it been 3 weeks delayed but i have already pay him so i said i keep chasing you and he said i have to check the text from the client that pay me more first and i said ok but i don’t think you are caring about my gold as a client so i prefer to stop here cause you don’t even want to do a plan and he said ok but the money is not refundable and i said how come cause here you are the one that haven’t done my plan you are the one that cancel my session last minute so i don’t think you should stay with my money when you didn’t care about if i feel bad or not just cause i pay you before so after 2 years paying him following him around he do this and stay with my money just like that very disappointed big disappointment 😤"

3,2023-04-22,Could improve...,"london woolwich. the gym is quite new so it wasnt listed. i have been a member for years on and off, i find puregym the best gym group among all the others. there wasnt any puregym near my area before so when this particular branch opened i was happy. you normally have really good floor plan and good equipment so i did not hesitate to sign up. upon my first visit, i felt disappointed. this location is very busy, so i expected a much bigger space to start with. its really small, machines are packed everywhere, there is barely space, and when it gets busy its like sardines in a can not to talk of you cant use any equipment because they are occupied all the time. there is an extremely small area for body weight training or exercise on the floor, its ridiculous and its facing the street and road so when doing abs or any other positions the whole street is staring and watching even from the cars. there is a studio room which is good size, thats where i normally get all my body weight exercises done, however if its busy because a class is going on, then only that small area is left to go to. some equipment is missing from this branch that i was using when i was in greenwich, i guess no space for them. the female changing room is ok, there are 2 toilets and showers, clean, however on many occasions there is quite a lots of water on the floor due to washing hands as the hand dryer is not right next to the sink but across on the wall. also, when someone showers the steam doesnt escape right away and the changing room gets real humid which is unpleasant and i have not experienced this in other branches. i have only seen 2 staff so far, spoke to only 1 and babatunde always has a friendly approach and a smile for everyone. i saw him cleaning the equipments the other day which is really good as some other branches lack this step unfortunately and equipments are filthy. overall, this branch is a let down for me, and if i had a better option near my area i would change. 5/10. to add, your orpington and greenwich branches are amazing, 10/10, i truly miss working out there."

1,2023-04-16,Pure Gym puts members at Danger,"this evaluation arises from the observation that pure gym at bow wharf, and the company as a whole, prioritize profit over member safety. although i initially thought it was a good gym, on 16.04.23, a fellow member attacked me from behind without any provocation in the evening. fortunately, i was able to manage the situation, and nearby individuals performing islamic prayers heard my call for help and assisted in restraining the attacker. the police arrived shortly after and arrested the assailant, who was charged, but did not disclose his motives for the assault. i informed the gym of the incident, but they refused to cancel the attackers membership since it occurred outside the gyms front doors and because he is a member. i am concerned about the safety of other members since the gym has chosen not to inform them of the situation and is content to keep the attacker as a member, putting me in a difficult position. the following is my letter to them with legal obligations they need to fulfil which they are will to ignore.  dear pure gym bow wharf management,  re: pure gym puts members at danger - attacker mohammed baree  i am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding your handling of the matter where a pure gym member carried out a violent attack on me outside the gym premises, but on the canal & river trust grounds. the attacker, the attacker, was charged under the criminal justice act 1988 and now has a criminal record for his assault on me.  it is utterly disgusting that pure gym is retaining this violent criminal as a member, placing all other gym members at risk. this is not the first instance where a gym member has carried out a violent attack, and yet, the gym has taken no action to prevent such incidents from occurring. i refer to similar cases where gyms have failed to take appropriate action to protect their members, and such incidents have resulted in serious injuries and even fatalities. it is unacceptable that pure gym bow wharf is putting its members at risk by allowing violent criminals to retain their memberships.  in the united kingdom, gym members have a legal right to safety while using gym facilities. gym owners have a duty of care to ensure the safety of their members and take reasonable steps to prevent any foreseeable harm.  under the occupiers liability act 1957, gym owners have a duty of care to ensure that the premises are reasonably safe for all visitors, including gym members. failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harm or injury can result in legal action against the gym.  in cases where a gym member carries out a violent attack on another member, gym owners have a legal obligation to take appropriate action to protect their members. failure to take appropriate action can be seen as a breach of the duty of care owed to members and may result in legal action.  there have been several similar cases in the uk where gyms have failed to take appropriate action to protect their members from violent attacks. in one such case, a gym member was stabbed to death by another member in a fitness class. the gym was held liable for the death of the member as they had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the attack.  in another case, a gym member was attacked in the changing room by another member. the gym failed to take appropriate action, and the attacker was allowed to remain a member. the victim successfully sued the gym for failing to protect him from harm.  in cases where a gym member carries out a violent attack on another member, gym owners must take immediate action to ensure the safety of their members. this includes revoking the attackers membership and informing all members, tenants, and visitors of the incident and the steps being taken to ensure their safety.  in conclusion, gym owners have a legal obligation to ensure the safety of their members and take appropriate action to prevent any foreseeable harm. failure to take appropriate action can result in legal action against the gym and can have serious consequences for the safety of gym members.  furthermore, i will be taking this matter to the media as it is evident that the gym is more concerned with making money than ensuring the safety of its members. it is my hope that the media will highlight this issue, and the gym will be held accountable for its failure to take action to protect its members.  i urge you to take immediate action and revoke the attackers membership at the gym and all other pure gyms to ensure the safety of your members. i also request that you inform all members, tenants, and visitors of the incident and the steps being taken to ensure their safety.  *i am concerned about my friends and other gym goers and only by writing this review maybe pure gym will rethink about safety then profit."

3,2023-04-19,"Don’t recommend, keep looking","have been going here for a few years, only because it’s the most closest to me. quite disappointed and can’t wait to move gyms. it’s very tiny and cramped, the organisation of the equipment is quite poor, i understand it’s difficult to work with small spaces but more could be done for gym goers to be able to manoeuvre around the gym more efficiently. placement of weights is hard to access. don’t even get me started on the bathrooms and and changing rooms, soo tiny and you don’t feel secure or safe at all as they are unisex. bathrooms are always messy, sanitary bins will stay filled for upwards of 3 days. not worth it for the price of £38 a month, and quite frustrating how we are unable to use certain spaces whenever there are certain classes going on, i understand we do need to accommodate, but why am i paying to not be able to not be able to do my workload in peace and access certain areas e,g. the cycling, stretching and free weights area? honestly would recommend if you are able to travel to a different local gym to do it, eg the gym in canary wharf or stepney, a bit further away but deffo worth it."

3,2023-04-19,Good overall but see full review…,"gym is spacious, nice equipment etc - maybe needs a couple more machines to keep inline with other gyms and different variations of exercises. (hack squat machine and better played chest press frame) also some of the machines are clean at face value but are dusty behind the seat/around the metal frames. also the male pts especially in the gym seem very judgemental and are always staring at people. a few people have said to me they either feel intimidated or a bit anxious doing certain exercises.. overall a good gym and i go as it’s convenient / near work but could definitely make a few improvements"

3,2023-04-20,"Good, but with few major problems","the gym is relatively large, spaced out and got a decent selection of equipment. overall it is a rather good place to train. why only 3 starts, well because of two things really. the air conditioning is pretty much non-existent. it is inevitable that you will start overheating and sweating even after basic lifts. but my main gripe comes from the cleanliness of the gym, and the overall gym culture. not only does only maybe one member of staff actually bother with maintain the standard of the gym high, by re-racking the weights, but the people who go to the gym dont seem to bothered about the maintenance of their own gym. when approach, most people are rather blasé and rude about it, as because others arnt re-racking their weights and its not pulled up by the staff they are entitled to do it themselves, which is quite frankly a joke. but, if the area which i live in is that primitive, then i guess i will just have to deal with it and maintain standards within myself"

2,2023-04-21,TOILETS,"puregym ok nothing special just like most gyms staff very nice and equipment works well and clean until you need the loo,the toilets are spacious and the showers look good but several of the hand dryers have not been working for weeks so you have to go out to the gym area and get the paper towels there while dripping water as you go which can be dangerous but the main thing about the toilets are that they are unisex for both men and women (thats if women use them as they are disgusting as men spray everywhere when using them and you go in and you find smelly urine floors and toilet seats which makes me turn around and walk out as i refuse to use them, i know they get cleaned regularly but it is a huge thing to not be able to use the loos,,apart from that the gym is just ok,purgym please put in ladies toilets only then you will get full marks,this is my honest opinion. thanks for youre reply puregym but that was a not a reply i was looking for as it was just a basic email that gets sent to everyone,i did ask you to put ladies only toilets in, one would be suitable,youre management wouldnt do anything without youre permission so the email you sent was pretty unhelpful and blasé, all you need to do is which wont cost you money is put a sign on one of the toilet doors stating ladies only."
4,2023-04-17,Nice clean environment but the showers are poorly designed.,nice clean environment with good equipment. classes are brilliant so far with friendly and knowledgeable instructors. the showers are hugely disappointing and no members i know will use them. there is a huge gap under the doors (probably near knee height for most women) and the doors themselves are frosted glass which is partly see through. id use the gym more often and be more likely to keep my membership if this facility was better designed.

4,2023-04-17,Overall experience after 4 months,"overall experience not too bad, i personally like to train there. it can get really busy at peak times like anywhere else. i have been a member for four months.i will leave my detailed review below:  1. parking. you can park in st. george’s car park for free which is just a short 2-3min walk from the gym. 2. changing room/cleanliness. i think the male changing room could be bigger for the size of the gym, but i never had an issue finding a free locker. the cleanliness of the changing room which i am the least happy with. the area by the toilets and the taps are always dirty and it probably could do with a bit of a refurbishment. i haven’t seen a cleaner actually cleaning in there yet. i have used other companies before in the same price range and i came across with cleaners regularly. i don’t use the showers, so i can’t comment on that. 3. equipment. higher end matrix machines, dumbbells up to 50kg. ski-ergs, really good spinning bikes, battle ropes, medicine balls, sand bags etc, loads of good equipment. plenty of barbell free weight stations. good number of benches as well.7 stations where you can use a barbell with free weights, which is quite good. the negatives for me are: only 1 flat bench, at least one more would ideal and leg machines. there is no standing calf machine, one more free weight leg press would be nice and a hack squat machine. there is a good range of cardio equipment and a spacious fitness studio area.  overall not bad for the price. if you are looking for a new gym or a change i would recommend puregym stevenage."

3,2023-04-17,Decent Gym for the price,"its has a lot of equipment and many different types to use but it does get extremely busy so you could be waiting for a equipment piece for a while. people tend to leave bottles and other litter around the gym which does sit there for a while before it gets cleaned. i have been there at many different hours of the day and havent ever seen a staff member wipe down a machine. i have seen rubbish left in the drink holders for multiple days. those are the gripes  the benefits are its quite spacious, ive been to a couple of the classes and the people running the classes are very friendly and helpful so i plan to go back again for more classes. regular gym goes keep to themselves and it is generally a quiet atmosphere. just wish people would put their weights back and not leave equipment everywhere. the main reason i joined this gym was for the 24 hours availability that is the reason i chose this gym over others"

4,2023-04-18,I have really enjoyed the classes,i have really enjoyed the classes and the staff are very polite and helpful. however it’s unfortunate there are not any pilates classes  in the evening and it’s a shame. pilates it’s a great work out for strength and flexibility. i know there is one in the morning but people have work. i have noticed there zumba and yoga classes it will be beneficial to add a pilates class in the evening.

(used to use gymgroup and bannatynes)"

1,2023-04-19,Unhelpful and unprofessional staff,"on 30 march 2023, i was at the kidbrooke branch of pure gym using the leg curl machine. i was forced to stop using the machine when a large male approached and intimidated me in stop using the equipment. i sought support from a pure gym employee called omar who was standing at the reception desk. he accepted that my treatment was unfortunate but then told me “that’s just the way it is here”. as we talked, i observed the man (who had intimidated me and bullied into stop using the machine) laughing at me with his buddy. when i expressed my dissatisfaction at the lack of support, omar said that i should make a complaint to management. i haven’t been back since. if it was possible to give 0 out of 5, i would have given this score."

1,2023-04-19,"Too busy, selfish clientele","too busy, not enough equipment and multiple groups of people together taking over equipment for lengthy periods. also individuals  doing ridiculous amounts of sets on benches and equipment that would put a professional body builder to shame but minus the physique. this leaves me exasperated and constantly having to approach individuals when they will be finished. with these selfish people  and no monitoring from staff i will be looking to go elsewhere as it is impacting on my training."

1,2023-04-17,Nice space and a good atmosphere,"nice space and a good atmosphere, however, the machines are quite old and some cardio machines have been broken for days now, or maybe weeks. the showers have been luke warm for the past few months, even in cold weather, and last time i was there, which was yesterday, the water was completely cold. i understand that energy bills are astronomical these days, but it isn’t fair for the users, who expect to have a hot shower after working out, at least i think people do. also in this instance, there wasn’t even a notice, saying the showers were cold, so i undress, get all my bits, go to the showers and press the bottom about four times, hoping it will get warm! and then i turn around, get dressed again, and then i go to have shower at home!"

1,2023-04-20,Bacteria infested swamp.,"about 2 months ago, i arrived at the gym to find that the women’s toilets were all out of order which is a monthly occurrence here due to all the mentally impaired people who work out here - clogging it with their sanitary towels among other things. it was no surprise.  i went up to management, needing to go to the bathroom. they informed me that they would accompany me to the male toilets to which i replied “i’d rather not as those will be filthy”. she reassured me that they had been cleaned “thoroughly” by staff, ready for women to use. i followed her to the male toilets, waited by the cubicles (both were in use). someone came out,..walked past her and me without washing their hands. once again not surprising, simply disgusting. i went to the bathroom, came out after touching the door handle which has probably never ever been cleaned since this place opened and headed to the sink. pressed on the soap machine, and there was no soap. despite the manager confirming that it has all be sorted etc. i turn to her and say “there’s no soap” she then turns to a locker to see if there’s soap stored there. there is not. i’m standing there in shock and mind boggled - thinking “when was the last time they even filled this up”. i would also like to mention this was at 5pm during rush hour. supplies should be doubled for that time. it was evident that she lied. the toilets were not clean, there was no soap and every single man who went into that bathroom could not wash their hands so they were just spreading their toilet infested hands all over the gym equipment. in addition to this, the antibacterial pumps are far and few between. 9/10 are empty whether that be at the entrance or down in the weights area.  i headed back to the women’s lockers to find out that people had forced their way into 2 out of the 3 toilets and tried flushing and flooded the whole bathroom. sewage just floating around. what a great start. bacteria not only on my hands but also in the air. what an absolute disgrace.  i’m not sure what is worse but having the manager lie to your face about the “thorough” clean that was done is honestly pathetic.  if there is another pandemic,..i’m sure it’ll spread nice and quickly here.  bring your own wipes, gel and soap cos they sure won’t have it here."

2,2023-04-16,"Ok'ish, but could be SO much better with some effort","classes run at this gym are generally demanding and well run by some excellent staff. however, the changing room facilities are nearly always lacking. the changing facilities for women are poorly maintained - shower number 3 (of 5)has been out of use to a poorly fitting glass door, for over 3 weeks causing delays from queuing. the one and only soap dispenser has been broken for 2 weeks and falls clear of the wall when use is attempted. when asked three days ago if this had been reported, a female cleaner replied yes but had no idea if/or when it may be mended. many days see the floors unclean with assorted rubbish and mess which gives a poor impression. there seems to be no ""members internet"" which makes individual training less attractive as tv etc cannot be viewed...(there are no screens on any machines, so no chance to watch anything at all, unlike many other gym groups. all-in-all, with some extra effort and attention by the pure gym group, broadstairs gym could be very good indeed, but at present it has to do better before i give a top score... hopefully, i will be able to do so soon"

4,2023-04-19,Suits Me,staff are mostly friendly.  classes can be too short at 30 mins for many of them.  45-60 mins works better for me.  i only use the classes so cannot comment on the gym equipment etc.  suits me geographically and like that i can invite a friend if i choose to.

3,2023-04-19,Decent,"gets really busy around 4-5 ish which can’t be helped. i also don’t think the space is utilised properly within the gym. also in my experience whenever i go, the ac is low or not even turned on when it’s busy it gets too hot and it stinks"

5,2023-04-19,Relaxed atmosphere,good range of equipment and relaxed atmosphere
1,2023-04-19,Puregym is a joke,"membership prices keep going up and for what? dirty bathrooms, leaky ceilings, broken machines, no blue roll/sprays for cleaning, no follow through with members who leave all their weights all over the place, and not enough staff to clean it all up. the convenience of having 24h is truly not worth it anymore."
3,2023-04-19,Toilets could be cleaner,toilets could be cleaner only 2 dual cable machines which are popular too many people hanging around equipment but not using it

3,2023-04-19,The gym equipment itself is fine,"the gym equipment itself is fine. three small gripes, the showers used to be hot now they are just about warm, the driveway approaching the gym is riddled with potholes & the opening time on weekends should be 6am same as during the week and possibly slightly later closing time"

3,2023-03-06,"Great PT, no so the group class","i very much enjoy my individual sessions with my pt becca, but not so keen on the group class i attended.  the music/thumping noise was so loud i couldnt hear the trainer properly and it was dark so couldnt see him either!  not a great welcome for a new member of the gym."

4,2023-04-16,"""Tools"" with little Wi-Fi","plenty ""tools"" to target your goals training. also, available studio when there is no class (obviously) in order to practice movement, stretching, own training, etc... the only negative point is wifi, doesnt work very well. in case anyone wants to research some exercises tips on the internet."

3,2023-04-16,crowded,"crowded , unclean gym and equioments needs mainteances like treadmill and other weight machines"
3,2023-04-19,What is your goal?,"standard gym,  suitable for beginner/intermediate. because it is a standard gym, it is unlikely to see machines such as seated hamstring curl or hacksquat although you will have enough material to work with.  staff is friendly and polite and theyre keeping the gym safe and clean. now, there are four things i absolutely think must change. 1- out of shape/fat pts. 2- many machines need clean-up and adjusting. 3- a must: hacksquat, calves and hipthrust machines. 4- texting during training while occupying machines. many including myself are taking training seriously and talking to people i found that we all think the same ""too basic thus creating clutter as everyone uses the same machines, so we need variety"". my experience has been decent so far and its 24/7 which i believe is the best feature. stay safe"
5,2023-04-19,Good gym,nice environment. lots of kit. plenty of space

5,2023-04-19,Great visit,"great visit, although i’m a member for a couple of years i haven’t been for 9 months. my passion is road cycling but i was knocked off my bike last year and haven’t been to the gym while recovering. i booked a 30min session for familiarisation, a good decision as the layout was recently changed (no notice or info from the club!!) and the machinery is new too so it was a good visit. some good tips and info from dejon too."

1,2023-04-19,The squat rack been out for months,"the squat rack been out for months, hardly any lockers work. cable machines all stiff. tried to open up all puregyms in leeds to compensate closing the gym while they fix it. membership already included access to other gyms anyway. cancelled, no reply to emails, terrible service. joined the gym group instead and its cheaper, better quality equipment, much cleaner. dont use puregym, use the gym group!"

1,2023-04-19,Not what it says on the tin,"gym facilities are good but it’s a 24/7 hour gym sat in a 6am-10pm car park. for the average user that is probably no problem but i have a very busy life and need to go the gym from 5am. i have already been given a parking ticket and have had to chose between not going or going when it’s open. not only have i had to reschedule my whole day/ life around fitting in this time slot but it’s at the busiest time of day. i haven’t seen the live numbers below 113 people when i’ve been in there which again adds time to my workout. the staff and equipment could be the best in the world but for placing it where it is completely takes away the one thing that stands the gym out from the rest. i do not feel i should have to find alternate parking and walk to a place i pay monthly for; it’s preposterous. there are no other gyms around that are convenient to use for me so until this is sorted out the gym in my opinion is completely useless. if you are going at more sociable hours then nothing in particular makes this gym stand out as being any better. it’s very busy all the time, sometimes hard to get the machines/ equipment you want without waiting, sometimes a substantial amount of time. better off supporting a local family run gym where complaints like this will be duly noted and taken into action. pure completely refuse to try and make any changes to the situation. currently reviewing the situation with the third party parking company"
3,2023-04-19,I’m assuming this relates to the…,i’m assuming this relates to the complaint a while back. the outcome was good but the experience of getting there was soooo tedious.  really it would have been better just to speak to someone but there’s no option for that just the achingly slow chat

5,2023-04-19,I really like this gym,"i really like this gym, my only problem is that sometimes there is a lack of equipment, but it is understandable because it is open 24 / h and access to the locker room and showerroom after 24:00 is sometimes a problem in some gyms, and yet we pay for 24 hour service."

5,2023-04-19,Great Gym,"the manager, tony, was really helpful and polite when i needed help with a machine. gym was clean and tidy."
2,2023-04-19,Downhill since price-rise,"2 cross trainers not working, one side of a cable machine not working, water fountain not working, lift broken (so no disabled access upstairs), weight station pin shortage, no staff to advise novice users to stop crashing weights or remind users to wipe down equipment... best gym ive belonged to mainly, but gone downhill since price went up."
1,2023-04-19,Worst gym I have been,"it is even worse than the most basic low cost gym. the customer service of the company is basically useless as one of the staff members mentioned once and this supposed to be ""cluster mgr"" how one of the customer agent called it that was supposed to reach out to me for a security breach happened in the gym i signed up for 2 months but only went barely 1 month never contacted me so i am not even sure there is any senior team in this company and comes across a company that does not care about the customer and that only wants to take the money giving little to no quality or service at all, the gym opened in january had machineries already loosen after 1 month, the gym manager that totally ignored my multiple emails, the gym constantly packed of people and most of the equipment needed missing as they dont have a maximum capacity reach limit,clearly it is a quantity targeted gym not quality clearly and to be in an old mall of stratford the price does not match the quality. i am so disappointed from this choice from the first week i have signed in and used it only a month and the second month went only once and then deleted my membership with them as it is wasted money and i dont feel safe leaving my belongings in the lockers of the gym after a very superficial and unprofessional team member left my laptop and my bag and all the other valuable i had in my locker unattended after proceeding to cut my padlock open by mistake and the most ridiculous thing was me having to chase multiple times to have this padlock replaced at least that they broke, it was the worse gym i have been in my life and i do not recommend it at all, it is absolutely not worth it, the only good thing are the gym instructors, most of them are nice, in particular simona she was very kind and does good classes, besides that i really do not recommend the pure gym as it lacks of the min customer service standards and the management of the gym and of the customer service in general it is very very disappointing under so many levels, really terrible experience and felt i wasted my money big time!!!"
1,2023-04-19,The lax of flexibility of cancelling…,"the lax of flexibility of cancelling classes, even if there is circa 20 spaces let if i cancel with 4 hours notice i am penalised. with having children last minute issues come up, as such this is an unattractive aspect of pure gym. similarly, i have turned up to classes and the instructor cancels them on the spot, therefore its a different rule for the gym users than for their staff. i would recommend a 2 hour cancellation period similar to that a few years ago. this has been the scenario at glasgow to royston and bath street"

3,2023-04-14,Manager being rude and unhelpful,"the manager was covering for someone else on saturday - he didnt show us the exercises until many people asked, he didnt make us do warm up nor stretching at the end. the class was supposed to last 45 minutes and he only did 30 minutes as he was the only one in the gym and wasnt supposed to be there (quote). being the manager that doesnt set a good example and also put me in a difficult position feeling embarrassed that i bothered him asking him to do his job. i do appreciate this is a basic service and it is a cheap gym but if you provide classes then some standards should be met as people do try hard to follow a routine and be healthy and this behavior is very demotivating."

3,2023-04-19,"Good gym, but WAY too busy, all the time.","pros:  large gym over 2 floors with lots of new equipment.  clean (most of the time).  most of the staff are nice and friendly.  variety of classes (if you can get a space).  good, easy-to-use app.cons:  as others have said, this place gets rammed.  everyone wants to go after work/uni or at lunchtime and it is so busy.  you probably wont be able to get on the machine you want to at the time you want to because therell be a teenager sitting on it, but not using it, just scrolling on their phone.  its like a youth club most of the time with all the kids there.   if you dont have a job or go to uni then youll be fine going in the morning or afternoon when everyone else is at work.parking - dont even think about getting a space in the evenings, especially before a class starts.  however, you can park up by victoria park, its free for an hour. ive had classes with most of the staff, valerio, daisy, callum kay - these are the best of the bunch, esp valerio - so happy and friendly.  the others though...not so much, they clearly hate their jobs and look like theyd rather be back in their beds. there needs to be more strength and sweat classes though - these are the most popular ones (that i enjoy going to), and are always fully booked unless you remember to book a space the minute it appears on the app.   the studio is way too small for the 30-35 people that are lucky enough to get a space.  the last 10 people that arrive are usually crammed together by the door.    solution:  put more classes on and reduce the max number of people by 5 or so."
5,2023-04-19,Out of all the gyms I've tested,"out of all the gyms ive tested, puregym is the one ive stayed with for the longest. yes, at times its busy but most gyms have their peak times, but seeing as puregym is open 24/7 its easy to find times where its less busy. i would recommend puregym to anyone."

2,2023-04-18,Overcrowded youth club,"if you want a gym that is over crowded, full of kids many of which are under 16 then this is the place for you.  poor layout of equipment which in a lot of cases means you have to stop doing your exercise so people can get past, feels like a youth club most of the time with 4 or 5 kids working in on a machine or just lingering on phones.  no way near enough cable attachments for the 14 cable points available.  if you have time to burn and dont mind doubling the time it would normally take do your workouts then this is the gym for you. if you want a gym with better equipment, a better layout and more like minded people then i would look elsewhere as i have now done."

1,2023-04-12,Morally bankrupt money grabbers,"the gym is great, as are the shop floor staff. but the company is morally bankrupt and only out to claw as much money from customers as possible. all over their website it talks about flexible packages, the ability to change as required. the reality is if you want to upgrade (give them more money) the process is simple. but downgrading is not possible without cancelling your direct debit (i have experienced this and a quick google tells me i’m not the only one). when you try downgrading on the website, they take you through a circle of web pages right back to where you started. when i contacted customer services i received a response of “it’s easy to downgrade, click here…” taking me straight back to the circular process again. they caveat this message with “if this process doesn’t work, you can cancel your direct debit” (you didn’t need to tell me, i have…). another really sad example of corporate greed trying to get one over on their (loyal) customers. frankly i have better things to do than mess around with cancelling direct debits only to then go through the whole sign up process again (with a setting up fee!), only for them to take advantage of me again.  update: following the response from puregym (below) i have copied in part of an email chain from customer services which demonstrates that they don’t easily downgrade memberships at customer requests, and they do recommend cancelling direct debits:  “thank you for your message.  we are sorry you feel that we are ""spouting lies"" when informing you of our cancellation process.  also mentioned in the previous email is the information ""if youre having issues this way its nothing to worry about, you can also cancel by ending your direct debit agreement with your bank""  this issue can be resolved by contacting your bank directly and cancelling the direct debit.  we are unable to cancel the membership on behalf of a member otherwise i would do so for you.  we are here to help and advise on the issues at hand as best as possible for our members.”  i’d be intrigued to hear more from puregym as to what has happened here…"

5,2023-04-07,9/10 more flexibility is needed.,finchley road is a fantastic site. with a great range of facilities and something to have a look at when you are running on the treadmills (street view). the same goes for any other site i have visited. i think the only thing that could be improved is the changing room times (to be open after 00:00). and also it would be useful to be able to change the date of payment and also be able to delay it for a fee.

3,2023-04-17,Great but could be better,the instructors are great and the classes are fun but most times there’s just too many people in the studio so it’s difficult to workout in a comfortable way.  i would recommend less people per class and possibly some markings on the floor to limit each person’s space
4,2023-04-17,Excellent equipment,"the gym i use has an excellent range of equipment but because of covid, some of the machines are unnecessarily close to each other and not everyone may be aware of their covid status. occasionally machines are out of service for long periods."

3,2023-04-17,not enough machines but can stretch,i feel as though there needs to be more than 3 lower body machines especially with the high volume of people visiting each day. really like that there is a stretching area though because for some reason a lot of other gyms dont have one
3,2023-04-17,Poor app and website but nice gym,"poor app and website. broken links which meaning i cannot upgrade to a plus account. apart from that, the actual gym is fine. the only thing i would change about the new layout in the gym is that the leg curl shouldn’t face the treadmills… this makes for very awkward eye contact."

4,2023-04-18,"Nice gym, have now fixed aircon","really like that the gym is accessible at any time. sometimes it gets a bit busy so its hard to get on equipment but most of the time its ok, midday is best. theres a good variety of equipment and instructions on machines are followable for beginners  toilets seem reasonably clean.  main thing i dont like is its too warm for a gym & the fans on the treadmills dont blow any air. the heart monitor is hard to get working too and seems off on all treadmill machines.   update: we now have aircon, thank you puregym!!!"

1,2023-04-18,Terrible Internet,"great space but the official o2 wifi is beyond awful to the point of being unusable (with poor indoor signal unable to supplement) which is incredibly frustrating to have in your gym. considering leaving if it doesnt change soon.  edit: the reply from puregym references the wifi that i also reference in my review. yes, free o2 wifi exists, but it is borderline defunct, and more frustrating than convenient to use."
1,2023-04-17,You’ve been warned ❗️The gym has good equipment and staff,"the gym has good equipment and staff. but, the level hygiene is extremely poor. the male showers and unusable as filthy. the male changing rooms are littered with bottles and dirt. a female member of staff often cleans the male changing areas when open.  there is no cleaning facilities for the equipment after use. the treadmills in particular are left covered in sweat.  this is not a clean gym. despite covid still prevalent, no cleaning facilities for the equipment after use are provided.  with thousands spent on new premises, cleaning and hygiene are not important to the owners. the health and welfare of the clients is not a priority to these owners.  enter at your own risk. perhaps bring a bio hazard suit.  such a shame. something so simple to sort is sort is ignored placing members health at risk. want to work out? you gonna need a vaccination first before you enter, or certainly a tetanus afterwards."

5,2023-04-17,Perfect gym for beginners or seasoned gym goers,staff are super friendly and it’s one of the nicest gyms i’ve been to. great selection of equipment and always spotlessly clean. there is currently a refurb going on but this hasn’t impacted my work outs at all as it seems to be really well organised and they give members lots of notice and information

1,2023-04-18,Your customer service process is a JOKE!,"why dont you guys have a phone line?  ill be honest the gyms are great, i love the gyms. my issue is the customer service operation. how can a company raise millions in funding but cannot afford a working phone line operation to help customers? i made a mistake whilst signing up yesterday, and wanted to change my email address. when i called the number i found online, i was told to email or dm using social media. it was annoying, but i needed help so i did it.  i then reach out via social media to be told somebody will be getting back to me in 12 hours. 12 hours? in 2023 it takes 12 hours to reply to a message? what the hell?  to my shock it is now almost 24 hours since ive messaged and ive received no reply. ive had to now do my own research to reach out to specific members of member services to get my query sorted.  there is no excuse to not have an active phone line. microsoft teams is there for a reason. ringcentral, zoom, anything. i work in an office for an online company and guess what? we have lines which people can reach us on. its not hard to do that. even if for some strange reason you dont want to speak to customers on the phone, an online chat function would work too. your customer service process is complete rubbish (i cant swear on here or else i would) and needs overhauling or else you will start to lose people.  24 hours and counting for a simple request? for a company of your size? in 2023? do better."

Enforce the disabled spaces!,"decent gym. disabled bays are never enforced near the gym entrance. seen people in wheelchairs have to use further bays due to ignorant gym users. in reply to puregym, i shouldnt have to point it out to the manager. this is not a date/time occurrence. its daily, and usually the same cars. the cars are in clear view. warn them, and ban them if they dont stop."
1,2023-04-03,The muswell hill pure gym is probably…,the muswell hill pure gym is probably one of the worst organised gyms i have been to. the manager is not welcoming at all and there is an emphasis on what you can’t do when you are there rather than what you can do. please do not join!

1,2023-04-15,Too many per class again and printouts rare over last fortnight,saturday 15th 9am pump was 30 people in class id given up doing this class for a while until others complained and numbers set to 20 which is manageable and safe.  it was not comfortable and potentially dangerous. eddie had no printout .. so could not ask people to leave lucky to get 30 mins from 45min class. wont attend again till back to safe class!! on more upbeat note harry and jelenas classes top draw!
4,2023-04-18,Too much cardio not enough SBD capacity,overall very nice gym however the members are at fault for not being more respectful of the weights so you are left to search far and wide for the right plates / dumbbells .also the gym is very heavy on cardio and not enough benches or deadlift platforms

4,2023-04-16,The gym is user friendly the only down…,the gym is user friendly the only down side is the classes they keep changing times and it end up not suiting some of us. looks like they cater for one group of people. and the cancel classes a lot.
5,2023-04-16,Convenient and easy going gym,"convenient and easy going gym. many of the pts go the extra mile in classes. especially emma, jenna, jacob and aaron. the only improvement would be for some pts to put the same enthusiasm into their classes like the others."

5,2023-04-17,"Great gym, go on… give it a try !","i don’t use the gym equipment at the pure gym (peterborough brotherhood retail park) but i do go to the classes 3-5 times per week and can honestly say that there is something for everyone. the spinning classes are my favourite, if you want a great cardio workout , i would definitely recommend james o’s spin class (monday & wednesday evenings ) the body tone classes are also great and no matter what level of fitness you’re at, you can work at your own pace and select the weights to suit. there is yoga and palates for a £2 fee which is definitely worth it , only grumble is that these classes are a bit to late on the evening for me, it would be great if they had a yoga class around 6pm / 6:30 pm .  anyhoo if your wanting to try a gym but don’t want to be stuck in a year long contract, and you like to have a bit banta or chat on with folk , i would definitely recommend this gym based on their classes alone."
5,2023-04-16,Recently upgraded!,the gym has a nice vibe! the staff are friendly. the equipment is well-spaced.  not a lot to go on other than it is a good gym. they should venture into cold/hot therapy tho.

1,2023-04-16,The gym is full of underage people,"the gym is full of underage people. ive been a member of your westwood cross gym for around a week or 2 now and although i love the gym and the facilities, i have really thought about cancelling my membership and going elsewhere. the gym itself is great its just the number of underage kids youre allowing in the gym. i went with my nephew who is a 6th form student (17) and was pointing out so many kids who were below the age of 16 who attend his school. sometimes you go in there and its like a community centre for children just loitering around the machines. i have nothing against anyone who is genuinely trying to work out but you can see a lot of them are just there for somewhere to hang out.  in the changing rooms this evening there was a group of 4 or 5 just sitting in there smoking vapes. i had to get into an argument with them to move so i could access my locker.  ive seen them doubling up in the booth you have to enter to get inside the gym.  i watched 2 girls basically rounding round the gym screaming tonight almost like a playground.  i understand the gym is unstaffed at certain times but i feel like you need something in place so more regular checks are being made for this."
2,2023-04-16,The location is good and close to my…,"the location is good and close to my home. the atmosphere is not that welcoming. i attended a class and for the warmup we had to do burpees. i was in pain for 3 days after. as a previous pt i was astonished at the lack of structure and safety when planning a gym class. i joined due to friends also going there but again i have friends who have been approached time and time again by a particular pt and the charges are roughly £80+ per pt session, which is astronomical (or perhaps competitive) but people cannot afford to feed their families let alone pay £80 for an hours gym session."

1,2023-02-01,Overcrowded,very busy gym with little options of equipment - had to wait around for machines. went various times of day between 5am and 10pm always busy.   in a response to the reply from pure gym  i tried at all times of day if they say it can be at peak times. peak time seems to be between 5am and 10pm as the only times i found it to be easy was at 3am in the morning

4,2023-04-16,Excellent for the price,excellent for the price. lots of equipment and very clean. the staff are really friendly and always happy to answer any questions. the app has loads of information and it is even possible to see how busy the gym is. i felt really nervous joining the gym but i definitely didnt need to. the only slight niggle i have is that it is so noisy when there is a class on and the speakers seem to be on full blast. i am however totally impressed by how many free classes there are available! really pleased i joined.

3,2023-04-16,Very Lacklustre Experience at Alloa Pure Gym,"i have been a member of various pure gyms’ across scotland. i was delighted when i found that pg was opening in alloa. it opened in december last year and the last time in was in, around 3 weeks ago, there was still no wi-fi despite bringing this up with staff on 3 occasions. sadly the gym space feels a bit lack lustre and the poorest experience of any pure gym i have been in previously. lots of work still to do."
5,2023-04-16,The staff are friendly,"the staff are friendly, helpful and encouraging. then price is excellent and  the place is clean with ample equipment, however busy it gets. i was a little dubious at first as i am no spring chicken, but soon realised that age does not matter when it comes to keeping fit. i was thinking of packing it in but have decided to persevere as i am missing it after missing just one session."

4,2023-04-16,Good but limited opening hours,the gym is great the only problem is the opening hours are not the best for my situation as i have few hours to get my exercises in for the gym i go to (wisbech) please bare in mind not all gyms run by puregym have limited opening hours. im just writing this about my current gym. the gym is great for what it does have though.
2,2023-04-16,corporate membership at wrong rates,"i took out a corporate membership, despite my membership stating it’s corporate i’m not paying the correct fee. i’ve sent numerous emails and have yet to receive a response. the gym itself is fine (although the showers are always out of order!)."
4,2023-04-16,good enough,location is perfect for me
5,2023-04-16,Overall an excellent experience,"overall i have found pure gym to be an excellent fitness centre, most of the team are awesome and theres a decent range of equipment.  there are a few things that need addressing like members not wiping down equipment after use, some of the lockers are in need of repair.  there could do with being a few classes especially for those of us who are a bit on the heavier side as most are tailored around generic fitness levels and perhaps a midday/early evening combat class, as it is only on one day a week on a monday morning.  overall i cannot fault pure gym and really enjoy the experience"
3,2023-04-16,I think our gym cancelation policy is…,i think our gym cancelation policy is unfair. instructor’s standards varied. i only use it because of the location

3,2023-04-17,Its a good overall gym but recently it…,"its a good overall gym but recently it seems to be being neglected. a few machines either dont work full stop or are faulty and the gym equipment has issues with broken seats. just seems that management is more focused on other things rather than actually walk through the gym and try the equipment. other than that, it is what it is, cheap membership open 24/7, just needs maintaining."

2,2023-04-17,Gym is too overcrowded,gym is too overcrowded particularly in the evenings making it impossible to follow an exercise plan or enjoy being in the gym. also lots of teenagers use it. the staff doesn’t seem to enforce any policy on appropriate workout clothing as there are builders/ tradesmen in the work clothes wearing work boots and school children exercising in full school uniform including shirt and tie. this is not acceptable please enforce some standard form h&s point of view.

4,2023-04-16,A good gym,"a great gym, lots of classes on offer and the women’s own section is great and less intimidating.  i knocked a star off, as you have to cancel a booked class 4 hours before a class starts.  i was in a position last week whereby i wasn’t able to attend due to transport systems letting me down and cancelled an hour before and still got an email to say i didn’t cancel in time.  but overall i’m happy with the gym"

4,2023-04-17,Big to compact,"normal gym is lewisham branch but they have a hot water problem the last few weeks waiting to resolve,did not fancy cold shower so i thought would give this branch a try gave bromley a try a week ago found layout huge, catford similar to bromley ,although training area catford on one floor bromley has two floors,catford seems less airy than bromley similar shower change room layout.cardio machines at all gyms are capable but lewisham has the edge with video screens to give virtual run experience also training areas more compact at lewisham and there is also a 👊 bag corner so different feel to each location."

2,2023-04-17,I had a bad experience in this gym today,"i like this gym, despite many disadvantages,  but today l got angry  when l asked one member of the staff why cold water only in a shower (l tried two showers but both was cold),he joked its freez weather in this country, really not funny when you should take a cold shower and you paid not for that,hahai can make a conflict, but it is not in my interests, because it takes energy, i decided to leave a review here, maybe it will change something, you need to treat customers properly, another unpleasant story was about two weeks ago, there were some problems with money transfers at my bank and i got a not so nice message from the hall that i had to pay a fee for late payment, since i am a regular customer who has been visiting this gym over 5 months, they could have given at least two days to solve this problem, but on its a pity, not everyone is loyal, i can remain silent for a long time, but there is a certain limit beyond which one should not cross."
1,2023-03-18,What is going on with the Muswell Hill PureGym,"dear gym management, i regret to inform you that i have had a rather disappointing experience at your gym, and unfortunately, i cannot recommend it to others. despite my initial enthusiasm, i have found that your management seems to have little interest in addressing member inquiries or concerns, and your staff are treated poorly. i have observed several instances of abusive behaviour from your staff, which is unacceptable and unprofessional. in addition, the facilities seem to be neglected and not adequately maintained, with equipment often broken or in need of repair. as a paying member, i expect a certain level of customer service and attention to detail from the management of a gym, and i feel that this has been lacking in your establishment. i have attempted to bring these issues to your attention in the past, but unfortunately, it seems that my feedback has fallen on deaf ears. i hope that in the future, you will take steps to address these concerns and provide a more positive experience for your members. until then, i will be taking my business elsewhere. sincerely thomas"

5,2023-04-01,I joined PureGym bicester in January…,"i joined puregym bicester in january 2023 and overall, my experience has been positive. the gym is spacious and well-equipped, with a wide range of workout options. the staff are also friendly and helpful, creating a positive environment for my fitness journey.  one of the best things about puregym is its ample space. there is plenty of room to move around and find your own spot to work out without feeling crowded. the gym is well-maintained and kept clean, which is important to me when it comes to hygiene and safety.  however, i did notice that on weekday evenings, the gym can get quite busy. it seems to be a popular time for many members to work out, and sometimes it can be a challenge to find available machines or equipment during peak hours. this can be frustrating, especially when you have limited time for your workout and need to wait for a machine to become available.  another issue i noticed during busy times is that some people tend to stay on the machines or equipment for longer periods of time while using their phones, without considering that others may be waiting. it can be frustrating to see people occupied with their phones, delaying others from using the equipment. i wish there were clearer guidelines or reminders for members to be mindful of others and share the equipment during peak hours.  despite these challenges, the staff at puregym are always friendly and approachable. they are willing to assist with any questions or concerns, and create a welcoming atmosphere. the positive environment at puregym is definitely a big plus, as it motivates me to keep coming back and pushing myself to achieve my fitness goals.  in conclusion, puregym is a good gym with spacious facilities, friendly staff, and a positive environment. however, it can get busy on weekday evenings, and some members may not be considerate of others when using their phones on the machines. overall, i would recommend puregym for its amenities and atmosphere, but be mindful of the potential crowds during peak hours."
5,2023-04-14,I like the application of Pure gym,"i like the application of pure gym, i feel more confident to go to the gym, i know which exercises works for me, very fun. the water machine includes many flavors. the sports equipment is excellent. the stuff are friendly,the best gym ever."

5,2023-04-16,A great way of life!!,great bunch of members and staff. exercise for my improving health and a little social life in between.
1,2023-04-16,Hard to cancel membership,"had signed up as was working away from home and needed a temporary gym. i believed i was not in a contract and could easily cancel membership anytime i wanted. again my location situation has changed and there is no easy way to cancel. i have to email membership team plus it appears i will have to pay 50% of the remaining time on contract (was not aware i was in a contract). easy to sign on, hard to get out. disappointed."
5,2023-04-16,Bike storage,"i’ve been going here for the last year and find it spacious, clean and well equipped. i’ve recently bought a fold up bike and was anxious about leaving it outside (even whilst locked) as other storage spaces in the retail park looked as though bikes had been stolen. i asked a member of staff if there was any chance i could bring it in folded and keep my eye on it (i expected to be told no but thought it was worth asking). all 3 staff members i came into contact with held doors open and allowed me to leave it in their staff room and could not be more helpful. i truly appreciate this as it’s my only way of getting around at the moment and isn’t exactly cheap. on leaving, a member of staff told me i’m welcome to have it stored there whenever i visit which i’m truly grateful for and feel so much more at ease about going more often now. thank you so much :)"

5,2023-04-15,Great layout,the layout was great. the day pass was cheap and accessible for my short stay.
2,2023-04-14,No where to secure valuables,male changing rooms have hardly any that can now be secured as they are mostly broken. male toilets stink to high heaven and make you feel sick if you have to use them.
1,2023-04-14,I wish this wasn’t the closest gym to me.,"half of the machines never work or are broken. staff look unhappy to work for puregym, unless they’re doing the own pt work. toilets are constantly messy and run out of toilet roll. wi-fi/cellular network is dreadful and you’re often left with no service which can be pretty dangerous if something happens in the gym. people who i have brought to this gym really don’t want to come back because of how it smells/mobile reception/things not working. it needs to be revamped immediately and to show puregym actually care about its gym members."
2,2023-04-15,Compromised Safety & Hygiene,"mostly, the gym is what i expect from puregym however, a few issues have forced me to write this review.  firstly, the male toilets are an absolute disgrace. regularly blocked, smelly and unserviceable, it posses a genuine health & hygiene issue.  secondly, the staff seem to spend most of their time on their phones in the office instead of walking the gym keeping on top of issues and problem members. things such as weight plates left all over the floor which pose a trip hazard, members being allowed to misuse equipment without being challenged, create a less than satisfactory gym experience not to mention glaring safety issues.  chatham gym really does have potential but has been let down by disinterested staff who have allowed poor gym etiquette and hygiene to ruin what should be a pleasant gym experience."
2,2023-04-15,Spam you constantly,"after unsubscribing from their emails and cancelling my membership repeatedly over a 2 week period, im still getting spammed by them daily 🤬"

3,2023-04-07,BRING BACK WIPING STATIONS,"i want to start off by saying the gym is looking really good and i have no beef where the equipment is laid out. i am glad they have got rid of most of the cardio machines because they were only ever used by new year new mes for about two weeks. please bring back the wiping stations. i have seen some very dirty/smelly people in there and they leave grease on the plates/machines. its vile!!  i must admit most of the gym staff are really friendly and bring a positive energy into the gym.  edited; further comments. went to the gym sunday and they have taken all the 20kg bars and weights from upstairs, which is where all the girls do their hip thrusts. i’m really annoyed at this. because this is where the boxes are. how are we meant to hip thrusts downstairs in the weight section there is no room? please keep this in mind and replace the equipment, thank you!"

4,2023-04-14,The Equipment is good,"the equipment is good, it’s just the maintainers needs to be kept up-to-date. the men’s showers are ‘smelly’ like the waste isn’t leaving the drain quickly? temperature of shower water could be a tad hotter, as i feel it could be why people don’t use them? other wise a good 24hr gym."

4,2023-04-14,A good sized gym very clean,"a good sized gym very clean. a variety of different people from young older large and small, quite inspiring sometimes. one fault is the music is switched off at night which makes a huge difference to motivation when its so quite. if this is done to save electric im sure turning the heating down would be a more significant way of saving money and its a lot more comfy when your kept cooler when training."
3,2023-04-13,Great friendly instructors,"great instructors, very friendly and welcoming. good variety of classes available. nice environment in general. studio area needs to be cleaned more regularly. sometimes no hot water in showers."

4,2023-04-13,Aircon please!!,"facilities are great, and the trainers are all lovely. downsides are the horrendous smell in the ladies changing room (stagnant water) and it too bloody hot in there. please, i beg you to crank up the aircon!"
5,2023-04-12,"Great staff, poor input from PureGym","the staff and classes at northwich puregym are faultless by and large. however, the the decline in classes and lack of input from puregym themselves is pretty poor. their refusal to update equipment, and their lack of staff support is bad. staff have left and not been replaced. again, i cannot fault the current staff, and the classes they maintain. my issue is with the puregym as a company."
5,2023-04-13,Group PT with Ellie is a must!,"i’ve been a member at saffron walden puregym since it first opened and i would always recommend this gym. however, my 5 star rating today is due to the new addition of ellie’s group pt sessions. ellie creates a fun and encouraging atmosphere. it’s a great way to stay accountable and push yourself with a professional guiding you. since joining them weekly i’ve smashed some of my pb’s, done things i didn’t think i could do while having a laugh with like minded people. really happy with this new addition to saffron walden’s puregym."

5,2023-04-12,I started training with Daniella back…,"i started training with daniella back in march following a four-year hiatus from any serious strength and fitness training. i was not sure what to expect when i started, but daniella put me at ease, and made me laugh… a lot. not what i expected at all, i never thought working out could be fun. i like the varied workout and customised approach each week. daniella ensures that you are doing every exercise correctly and consistently, paying attention to your form to get the most out of them. we made a pack that wed push each session as hard as possible, and she hasnt let me down. she also has information and tips on eating and understanding calories, i like her approach of not giving me a list of eating restrictions or a list of do nots or can nots, but instead gives a more sustainable understanding of calories. i switched focus very quickly from weight loss to strength and flexibility as these are the long-term gains, i need to sustain a healthy lifestyle. daniella ensures training sessions are varied and fun, so the time passes very quickly. her approach is very relaxed, and she makes it fun, but the progress is real! if you are considering working with a pt, i think you would struggle to find a better one than daniella! id happily recommend daniella to anyone looking for a new trainer."
2,2023-04-13,Reply to my previous review,reply to my previous review:  im sorry but claiming to be following government guidelines is no excuse for not being clean or hygienic. you dont need the government to tell you what is or isnt acceptable for paying members. we all pay for a clean safe environment to train in. at the moment thats not the case.

1,2023-04-12,DONT EVER GO HERE,"pure gym only give you the option of freezing an account and then charge you randomly when it unfreezes, whats worse is they wont even refund you.  as a customer you need the right to cancel flexibly when you need to, and when they wrongfully charge you to be refunded, however this is not the case.  bottom line is do not go here there just looking to pinch your money at any point with zero sympathy."
4,2023-04-09,Good,"good, clean gym with the necessary equipment and classes to get fit. more yoga and some pilates classes would be great! also the volume of the virtual classes is way too low. with the background music in the main gym and the low volume in the virtual classroom area it is very hard to listen to virtual instructors instructions. please raise the virtual classroom classes volume!"
1,2023-04-12,Mission to Cancel membership,"have used the gyms all around the uk due to work. most have been okay, odd one good and others pointless. biggest problem is customer service or rather lack of it!!!! in short, if you want to cancel your membership just cancel the dd on your account. you cant call them. you can only email or message through facebook. a business that only uses facebook messenger for direct customer contact is just farcical. what if you dont use facebook. they never responded to a single email recently."

5,2023-04-10,Gym experience since opening,"been going to this gym ever since it was opened like literally my very first time was like 1am on its opening day, coming 3x a week, sometimes more, and got probably a 40 or so visits so far.  like the app idea, tells us how many people is in at the certain times, and just generally has some useful information on there.  and what i could tell as of now, its pretty good place to come, especially for a beginner, it does get busy during busy hours/busy days, however second half of the week (weekends) or so, are much more quieter, and for people who works throughout the week and only has time at the second half of the week its really good place to workout / loose weight.  machines do break, but not as often as some people states here, i only get to see one machine in a week (if that), and well, its not really a big deal.  showers / changing rooms/lockers are fine, id say 8/10 cleaning wise, which is much better when most takeaways we order food from :).  staff - personally, i have never spoke with either of them, i mind my own business, they mind theirs, never been asked or approached, so if youre like me who just goes there to do their thing and avoid any human interaction is good place to go to.  not sure why some people had some issues with the male young manager, seems alright to me, but obviously, there is always two sides of the story.  overall space in the gym, its pretty packed and small, lots of equipments to use, sometimes you need to patiently wait for some of them to free up during busy times, but overall its just fine.  people in the gym comes in different shapes/sizes/ages/colours etc.etc which is great, as it does send the message that everybody is welcome, and we do need diversity in a place like this, to feel more confident.  never had to witness any conflicts inside the gym, so thats that, and it usually seems like everyone there is simply just minding their own business, which is a big +.  as of now, i would highly recommend this gym to beginners, and people who wants to be flexible with their times. also having tesco next door, and a huge carpark is huge bonus too, especially if you drive, and worry about parking.  ill update this review with time and experience."

1,2023-04-09,Still no water to refill bottles with…,still no water to refill bottles with not sure why you only have one water fountain anyway and no members of staff inside the gym whilst i was working out.the cleaning station bins were overflowing and the gym floor and toilets were a mess.
1,2023-03-31,Going down hill fast!,"been a member for years now and all puregym ho seem keen on is increasing prices to both the customer and also to the pts (which ultimately incurs a further increase to the customer) and driving good staff & trainers away to competitor gyms - and lets face it there are enough around and much cheaper than puregym. since the latest increase i have gone down to basic membership as i begrudge paying more and getting less for my money. the first perk took away was the massage chairs then the boditrax machine (free to plus members), classes have been greatly reduced with very limited external teachers now, the showers are constantly cold to the point that i dont shower here anymore as its too cold for me to use. the whole puregym ethos seems to be to keep offering student offers/no joining fee to ram in as many people as they can which has to be a safety issue, i cant imagine how 200+ people would all safely evacuate if the need ever arose.  once my pt leaves, then i go as i no longer have any loyalty to puregym. shame that greed has taken over this company.response as expected - no ownership for the price increase, cold showers or anything else mentioned - just same old story: ""contact your local branch"" - the issue is with puregym corporate and not the local gym whos managers are merely doing they are told!  grow a pair and respond according to the complaint rather than offer a generic reply!"
3,2023-04-09,Only one bench press and squat rack despite the size!,"a decent sized basement gym. very poor usage of gym floor space, limited to only one bench press and deadlift/squat platform which is horrible during peak hours. instead of investing in better quality matrix equipment, they utilised space for a massage section instead?  the space for cardio & treadmill is way too much and could definitely be utilised better with more of the common machines (i.e. bench press, squat racks)  the closing times are too early, especially on weekends. due to their operation cost they can’t extend their hours, but to avoid peak corporate hours there isn’t enough time! unless you want to constantly look for alternative exercises or wait in a queue for certain machines, the closing times should be extended at least an extra hour. it will help a lot of people!"

2,2023-04-07,Very mixed bag,"been a member now for just over a year. the gym is kept very clean, staff are friendly, and the machines ok. however, like others here, i feel that the water temperature has been turned down too much recently. this is a false economy, as to keep the shower just above lukewarm, you have to keep the water flowing continuously. i guess all companies need to make savings at present, but puregym have gone too far with the water temperature - a few degrees warmer please!  update may 2023 puregym seem to have taken note of the complaints and responded by raising the temperature of the showers (a couple of weeks ago). not to previous levels, but to an acceptable shower temperature. they have also shortened the length of time the shower flows when the button is pushed from 30 seconds to 20 seconds, which is fair enough. i have therefore raised the star rating of this review.  update 05 june 2023:- puregym certainly know how to p*ss-off their membership! a new revamp of the website has now removed entirely your attendance record, the only thing i used to use it for! it is now just advertising and trying to get you to upgrade. back down to 3*"

2,2023-04-08,I would have given this a 4* review but…,i would have given this a 4* review but since bst boiler has been turned down & showers are lukewarm at best with occasional blast of cold water. a hot shower even at a basic gym doesnt seem unreasonable. ho blame local manager & vversa car park officials penalise any encroachment on yellow hatching yet non badge holders regularly use disabled bays thanks for jd suggestion; after joining on opening im off
5,2023-01-20,Boston gym,"boston gym this is an awesome gym, particularly for the price. the equipment is great, i never have a problem with the technology or app, it’s super clean, friendly, great temperature."

5,2023-04-03,Improvements happening,lucy thank you for new equipments you are a gem to this gym and your classes are 101% you are the best
4,2023-02-18,I like Puregym,"i like puregym, is very convenient for me. the only problem i would say lately is the temperature. is really hot inside. any other gym when you walk in it is cold, but this particular gym is soooo hot that is makes it uncomfortable to work out."
4,2023-04-08,Great gym,"great gym, i’m there every second day, no fuss plenty of kit and open 24 hours"
4,2023-04-08,Excellent gym... but,excellent gym. great staff. my only issue is people sitting on equipment im waiting to use just texting on their phone or having a conversation with another person. i think it would be a good idea to have signs in the gym displaying gym etiquette as its really annoying. apart from that i really enjoy going there.
4,2023-04-07,Friendly environment and easy access…friendly environment,friendly environment and easy access and variety of equipment to use
5,2023-04-03,Brilliant gym everyone is so friendly…,brilliant gym everyone is so friendly as its getting warmer now they could crank up the air con but other then that its a perfect gym
1,2023-04-07,No Air Conditioning!!!,"main issue is the air conditioning. i have visited today at 6pm and air condition was not on and there was no staff around to ask to turn it on. this should not be something that needs to be asked to be turned on.  in the last 4 weeks the a/c had not been working for 3/4 days. i don’t know how they had kept it 4 days without a/c  also during ramadan, a lot of muslims visit the gym late night and again there is no air conditioning on.  due to this it’s hard to breathe firstly, especially with having asthma, it’s very stuffy and the equipment gets all sweaty which makes it really unhygienic. i’ve had to walk out everytime the a/c is not on as i struggle and i’m sure many others do.  i’ve sent an email which has not been responded to. i feel like because it’s a majority asian gym, they don’t seem to bother about these things.  fyi a/c can be scheduled on late at night, i have been to a gym out of oldham, late night 11.30pm and a/c was switched on.  machines are always broken and take way too long to fix. for example the smith machine, very popular and there is only two. one of the machines had been broken for just over 2 months. which meant i was either having to spend extra time waiting in gym or having to miss workouts!  next the water machine is broken and the sports drinks, which is paid for my members but then not available for a few days??  very very disappointed."
1,2023-04-06,The men's changing room is foul,"the mens changing room is foul, the toilets are disgusting and the urinals and sinks stink. also the showers are ice cold. ive had a year off and after coming back cannot believe the state of the gym as a whole, its was always clean and tidy before i had my break. only keeping my membership because its 24 hours. do better and sort the gyms cleanliness out please."
5,2023-04-07,Amazing quality and environment,amazing quality and environment. lovely and friendly staff and amazing atmosphere that pushes you to do your hardest.
4,2023-04-07,Great gym disappointing class length,"this gym is clean and friendly hence the good rating, but disappointed that another class is reducing to 30 mins from 45 mins."
3,2023-04-07,"Really busy, not always clean.","using puregym london road brighton. way too busy with over 100 people afterwork and daytimes averages 60-70 users. quietest time is early mornings before 9am. weekends are quieter but thats mainly because the catchment area attracts alot of students. i cant get to use the gym as much as id like, when i want too as its just too busy and as i have a disability, i am limited with the equipment i can use so if i cant get to use them, theres no point going, and no discount for disability. generally dirty early mornings following the busy evenings. such a shame for us local brightonians but i still go."
1,2023-04-07,Cold showers are really unacceptable,"cold showers are really unacceptable , why , why , have they lowered the water temperature to cold in the ladies showers ,at least make it warm !!!!!!!"

5,2023-04-07,Great fitness coaches!,the puregym fitness coaches at tottenham court road are great! very professional and excellent classes. i love the athmosphere at the gym and everyone is very friendly.
1,2023-04-03,Broken Equipment - Wonky Head Office Letting Down their Staff.,"it is ridiculous to just leave equipment broken for months on end. the bench press (of which there is only one) has been broken since the new year (4 months now) and likely will not be fixed for another 6. other equipment is also fraying or breaking down. surely, if your supplier cannot supply you can source from a 3rd party. this is insulting to both the membership and the pts who have also demanded the equipment be fixed. i hear the management has time to call meetings on gender neutral toilet use, but has no time to put workout equipment in a gym!? regardless, there should not just be 1 bench in a large gym. how can you raise membership prices and pt rent with inflation but not be bothered to fix equipment and support your hardworking staff and membership that pay for your business model? if there was a rival in the immediate area, the gym would be finished. puregym head office should be ashamed of itself."
5,2023-04-07,Great 1-2-1 training session with Brett…,great 1-2-1 training session with brett on glute training. staff always really helpful.

4,2023-04-07,Thanks,"thanks, friendly staff."
1,2023-04-05,Too busy,"i used to come here all the time during university, and really enjoyed it.  it seems to have changed recently, with a large amount of members joining which means i’m waiting for equipment. i’ve been a few times and haven’t bothered with my full workout. i’ve since left and joined an independent gym which i’m having more fun using."
5,2023-04-01,Good variety of equipment,"good variety of equipment, and a supportive , encouraging and positive environment!"
4,2023-04-06,generally fine,"the gym is always clean, staff very friendly and helpful, overall a really nice atmosphere.clases are great! i can really recommend. would be 5 stars but there are some minuses.the gym is not very modern compared to others. there is not much room for exercise if there are classes in the studio, and they are quite often,and the lights are tragic. the parking lot is totally dark, and everyone stops wherever they want, sometimes almost in the middle of the road to be closely to entrance even if there is planty of space on the other side of the building. water machine very often doesnt have refill. overall a great gym but it could use some renovation."
5,2023-04-06,Clean,"clean, friendly and not too busy"
5,2023-04-06,Good,im very happy with the experience
5,2023-04-06,Awesome staff!,"i never leave public reviews but honestly the best gym environment ive come across. the staff look like they get on and actually care about their clients. despite not having pt sessions anymore, joe always makes the effort to say hi & check in on my training. always coming in with the little boosts i need to get through my sessions."
5,2023-04-06,Clean equipment and lots of staff…,clean equipment and lots of staff available to help.
3,2023-04-06,You get what you pay for,hammersmith branch - you get what you pay for as they say. not the best gym but adequate. mainly let down by showers on timers and running warm or cold. plus the shower tray was dangerously slippery. if you read some other reviews inadequate shower facilities are quite a common complaint. most recently i saw something i have never seen before in a gym. there was some kid sitting on top of the pull up/dip station vaping. shortly after the fire alarm went off and the gym was evacuated. i reported the ‘vape monkey’ to a member of staff but don’t know if any action was taken.
1,2023-03-16,Account suspended for bringing my NHS provided carer,"worst place ive ever trained at, the showers are filthy and the staff are rude, they like to act like there busy by walking around with a feather duster but dont do anything to actually maintain the gym. removed first review aswell, brought my carer with me as not a single person here is trained on what to do if someone has a seizure due to my epilepsy, and a day later they suspended my account. have already signed up to jd gym and its x10 better, staff are friendly, cheaper aswell, sauna included, and its actually clean unlike this place!"
1,2023-03-31,MIKE AND IVA THE SNAKES 🐍,"wowowoow iva the blonde girl and mike must be racist to gang up on zee, she said she was suspended for telling iva to shut up ( she explained everything including the bench), yet the team has been bullying her for several months, isolating her, creating a whatsapp group that management knew about and didnt say anything to help her, instead a manager joined with his fiancé best friend (iva) to get rid of her, also on the list it says pin sharing, thats laughable even for you mike, who told zee 3weeks before she was suspended that you was scooping on the team, and checking on them, you also put that safety code,  and confidentiality breach... seriously we should of known you mike are a bad luck the moment you came to ilford puregym,  someone died, thats what you like to do!! kill people effort, dreams, hardwork... i hope you are happy with your bald self... you will surver the worst in your wedding day, for what you did to that girl... who stayed far away from people, gossip and hatred... by the way she has the recordings for everything......  next time at least tell iva to write the correct date on her statement,  instead of the date you scooped.... i told her to take legal actions,  but she said ""it is in gods hand""... so i respect her choices... otherwise i would leak all the audio and videos.... she showed me everything..."
1,2023-02-19,Have no valid manager's email…,have no valid managers email address/general email address or contact number to speak to someone about waiving pcns while attending puregym. they do not care about their customers receiving pcns.

1,2023-04-05,Disappointing.,"felt the need to leave this review after complaints to the (very friendly) staff have all resulted in nothing being done - all the staff are aware of the issues and aware theyre problems but are also aware that theres no action being taken to resolve any of them.  the positives:  1) just had a refurb 2) the new kit is great (always having to hunt down plates though) 3) the new flooring and free weights are are also great 4) the staff are friendly, knowledgable and approachable  the negatives:  1) air con leaking (and has now for 2+ years) in the free weights area, despite this being an issue before the refurb nothing has been done about it  2) changing rooms arent locked.. ever  3) damaged / poorly maintained older equipment, older machines have been poorly maintained and some are borderline dangerous due to issues such as grips spinning when theyre meant to be rigid  4) repair times - equipment and facilities are frequently broken, repair times take anywhere from 1-2 weeks to 2+months a recent example would be the only disabled toilets/shower room which had no lock for approximately 2 weeks.  5)mens locker rooms: a) broken lockers - id estimate at least 30% of the lockers are unusable due to damaged locks or frames b) damaged and poorly repaired urinal - the urinal fell off the wall and hasnt been properly repaired, this is still leaking and has led to the changing room frequently smelling quite badly due to this. c) changed shower temperatures and timings recently, they are now barely warm with frequent blasts of cold water to encourage you not to use them. d) 2 evenings in the last month the entire toilet area has been completely flooded  ive been a member off and on since this gym opened and it has slowly gotten worse, i would recommend using a different site.  **update**  a month and a half on, nothing has changed, staff are still great but its obvious the owners arent interested in putting any money into fixing anything. would still advise using a different site  **update #2**  another month on, still nothing changed, more equipment broken awaiting repair, shower temps still low and swing wildly between cold and hot"

3,2023-04-05,Where is the Yanga puregym Heanor,visited puregym heanor for the first time today as it is now more local then the previous one i used. all the equipment is good however i was disappointed to find out there was no yanga sports water machine. i expect this to be at every puregym however this is the first i have found without it. it is one of the reasons i purchased the plus multi access membership which is considerably more than a standard membership. also a little niggly comment that there was only one entrance and exit which was very busy and caused queuing.
5,2023-04-01,"Clean, slick gym","clean, slick gym. new equipment and weights are decent. six deadlift platforms.... perfection.  decent gym for the cost, can do all exercises you need to do."

5,2023-04-05,Max Cooper PT is excellent!,"the gym itself is a good size, easy location and clean. i’ve trained with max cooper since summer last year and honestly working with him has been a game changer. mentally & physically i’ve seen so many positive changes since we started training. he’s an all around great guy, super passionate about his work and really easy to get on with. as someone that was a little apprehensive about the free weights section he helped me feel comfortable and confident in that space. working with max helped take my overall lifestyle choices to the next level and my results have been speaking for themselves. couldn’t recommend max more. he is great with beginners but anyone at any stage of their fitness journey would benefit massively from his expertise and personal fitness story."
1,2023-04-05,"ONCE AGAIN, DO NOT JOIN THIS PUREGYM",in response to previous review - totally just ignore i stated that 95% of the lockers were broken and the ac system. you could have got in someone during the 6 days that you were closed to fix all the lockers and anything that needed maintenance... instead of charging your customers £18+ for most of the equipment and facilities being knackered and broken.
4,2023-04-05,Good gym!,i really enjoy going to the gym. the classes are always challenging and the staff are really friendly. there are lots of machines to use and different equipment available.  the only issue i have is that the ceiling of the studio is mouldy and there’s also leaks in the studio which make it hard to do classes.
1,2023-04-05,Car parking charges,car parking charges.  i’ve recently just joined and just received 8 parking charges.  i’ve tried to get to speak to someone at puregym about it and there’s no phone number.  i believed it was free onsite parking at portishead.  is this not the case?
5,2023-04-05,Awesome gym,"awesome gym . space / kit , all good. like it."

4,2023-04-05,I joined pure gym cardiff western…,"i joined pure gym cardiff western avenue, back last summer before they actually opened. i try to go 4/5 times a week, as a shift worker, the nights/early mornings are awesome, i pretty much get the place to myself. i cant imagine a gym having more kit than this place, the price is cheap in comparison to lots of others, cleaned around the clock almost. if i had to list a few niggles ( no place is perfect) id say the mens changing rooms are too small, for me the showers are too hot, the temp cant be changed, ppl are leaving empty shower gell bottles and even razor blades in the showers, people are not putting dumbells away or removing plates from machines after use, but none of this is pure gyms fault, my ocd sees me put loads of kit away for ppl when i go in the small hours ."
4,2023-04-04,Visiting as a tourist,"visiting as a tourist, i was happy with the service. the rates are good and i liked the ambiance and customer service. the gym members are also cordial and friendly."

5,2023-04-05,Recommending Dave Fuller for anyone interested in PT,"i’ve been going to this gym since 2019 and absolutely love it! i’ve been to various different puregyms all over the country and have yet to find one as good as skydome. there’s a great gym community and all the pts are wonderful, especially dave fuller who i started pt with around 3 months ago. as a regular gym goer who felt confident in the gym and didn’t lack the motivation to be in the gym 5/6 days a week already, for me getting a pt was about pushing myself beyond what i was able to achieve on my own. in just a few months dave has transformed my workouts and the weights i’m able to lift are flying up week on week, while by myself i had reached a bit of a plateau. dave makes every session fun and is so supportive and easy to get on with. i cannot recommend him enough!"
5,2023-04-04,"Best gym with the best PTs, namely Dave!","i’ve been going to this gym for nearly 2 years as it’s by far the best gym! all the staff are amazing and so friendly- everyone is so approachable and have helped me so much throughout my gym journey. special shout-out to my pt dave fuller who i’ve been with for a year now, outstanding in every way; he goes above and beyond to tailor programmes to fit my needs and my goals- and i’m happy to say within this year i have reached and surpassed many of my goals, something i never could have done without him! i would highly recommend dave as a pt, he’s not only helped me reach my fitness goals but has helped me so much with my nutrition, and with my confidence both in the gym and in my body!!"

3,2023-04-03,I would love to say this gym is perfect…,"i would love to say this gym is perfect but it’s not, no gym is. unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a limit to the amount of people on the gym floor (excluding classes), it’s impossible to plan a routine as you can’t get on the equipment required, for the size the max should be around 90-100 max, anymore and it’s a nightmare, majority of people train when they finish work so yes i generally train at peak times but you shouldn’t feel like you want to turn around and go home.another thing is the environmental control, quite often it’s too warm."
5,2023-04-03,Had a great first experience at puregym,"had a great first experience at puregym, jill an employee there was welcoming, warm and friendly and explained how to use the equipment very clearly. only thing i would improve really is make the air cooler because you heat up in there fairly quick working out.. other than that its a great gym and would recommend to anyone seeking to improve fitness and health."

1,2023-04-03,Supposed to be cheap but no student…,supposed to be cheap but no student discount and excludes sevenoaks and area. rip off to be fair.  they advertise great prices but sencio (when open) was cheaper!
3,2023-04-03,The gym is perfectly fine,"the gym is perfectly fine, good range of equipment and many olympic weight platforms. my only gripe is that there is nothing to wipe down equipment with, workout mats are put back with no way of cleaning them. the human body sheds nearly a million pieces of skin an hour and can sweat around a litre of water and hour during a hard workout (shedding loads of bacteria with it), this is not about covid but good hygiene practice."
5,2023-03-02,Sevenoaks PureGym,"lovely gym, clean, lots of options available, friendly staff, clear instructions, comfortable atmosphere"
1,2023-04-03,Gym opening times,the website is advertised as a 24 hour gym. i’ve turned up to the gym at 6 and it’s not open till 6:30. false advertisement and very disappointing.

1,2023-04-02,Trying to cancel membership,"trying to cancel membership, i follow the guidance provided online yet my membership is not cancelled most likely a site issue. email service is automated so nobody actually answers they just provide the same steps ive already repeated a multitude of times, and they have no active contact number. and their socials keep repeating the same thing as what their automated email did. how do i cancel my membership when your site does not let me? and how do i contact an actual human being?"

5,2023-04-02,Value for money.,i like the anti harassment policy in force. i hope puregym enforces it i personally suffered this which kept me away from gym for 10 years after inexperienced staff could not resolve it
5,2023-03-31,Good gym,good gym. quality classes .
4,2023-04-01,Great gym overall,"great gym overall, one of the best in the area.  decent kit, lots of options of machines, clean and 24/7.  really good value for money.  just lost a star because it could be so much better. as others have mentioned they could do with adding more kit. doing so would elevate the gym massively.  like a previous poster has a poster has mentioned the crossfit/functional area is very large. it would perhaps be better to use some of that space to house some of the current equipment in order to make room for more stuff. for example the fixed weight barbels and the ab bench could both be put in that area. which would free up room in the free weights area for additional benches and perhaps a hack squat and even additional rack or other plate loaded equipment.  space is taken up by massive cleaning stations which could easily be affixed to the wall, like they are in the studio. again opening up space in both the machine weights/ cardio area and free weights for additional machines.  the stretch area near the studio is also much too large for its purpose. and again could house extra equipment, or move current equipment into there to create room elsewhere.  finally it would be really useful if the blk box racks had spotter arms  overall the gym is fantastic but it could be a lot better, its not fulfilling its potential."
5,2023-04-01,Enjoying PureGym!,"although i’ve just recently joined, i’m really enjoying puregym. lots of good free weights/machine’s and decent cardio equipment too. also good to see plenty of concept 2 rowing machines. it will take a while to navigate it all but it’s something to look forward to. a good atmosphere, which is so important. the spin cycling class was awesome, cheers danielle! more classes to try out in the future. value for money? 100% cheers to craig too for giving me a tour of the gym before i joined."

3,2023-04-01,New Layout,please can you put mirrors back in the ladies changeroom?? its not enough to only have the one small one when so many people use the space!!  i also agree with the previous comment about making use of the window space for cardio machines. i would also add that the smith machines were better downstairs since you can work up from smith to olympic bar that way instead of changing floors.
4,2023-04-01,St Albans Herts gym,"enjoy the gym location near my home, flexible opening times, and excellent range of equipment. however sometimes the st albans gym air conditioning is not working and it’s too hot and uncomfortable to work out in so the air not very fresh. today no one to follow it up with on duty being a saturday morning."

4,2023-04-01,Out-of-town guest is impressed by West Brom,i bought an out-of-town guest membership at west brom. he was knocked-out by how good the gym was. hed never seen such a huge gym and thought the equipment was wonderful. his only disappointment was that he does not have a puregym near where he lives -- in darlington.

1,2023-03-31,Disengaged customer,"i joined puregym in november 2022 in newcastle, knowing i was relocating soon.  i was reassured i could attend any puregym in the country.  when i moved in january 2023, i eagerly went to worcester puregym.  all seemed well, until i received a head office email saying i would need to upgrade (pay more) to use worcester!  i cancelled due to their disingenuous attitude… btw cancelling is like solving the krypton factor.  funny, now they are sending me “come back” emails.  classic head office too far removed from their customers. be warned!"

5,2023-04-01,Such an amazing gym!,"such an amazing gym! all staff are amazing and approachable, the manager luke evidently works really hard to make this gym a fantastic place for its members! the classes ran by the team are amazing, in particular, the instructor agas classes always stand out to me, i wish i could attend them all! great gym, great location, and great staff!"
3,2023-03-31,Lack of customer support,"one big thing puregym can and should improve on is customers communication. there is no phone service and the online chat is automated so the query never gets answered and you still have an issue. it’s really really annoying. and when you email, no one ever reply. it’s now 2months and i’m still waiting ( i bet you will give the rubbish reason that it’s a busy period like you always say). it’s disappointing and frustrating to have a business care so like about there customers and make up excuses."
5,2023-04-01,Perfect For Any Fitness Goal,"open 24/7. an app which among other things, provides live information of how many people are currently in the gym. relatively cheap membership. lots of equipment and plenty of space. all of the equipment i have used has been in perfect condition.  the only negative i can say is in regards to the dumbbells. every time i go, they are in complete disarray. in all the gyms ive been in, ive never seen it as bad. when you want a pair, it wouldnt be uncommon for them to be situated on opposite sides of the free weight area (possibly on the floor).  that being said, i do not hold puregym accountable as this is during unstaffed hours and the weight racks have clear numbers on them for specific placement of all dumbbells. this is purely the result of inconsiderate gym members."

3,2023-03-24,Worn out.,"ive been a member here for many years but its no longer the great gym it once was. while the gym still has some really great pts (anthony, wayne & deano), its frustrating how much equipment is completely worn out. steppers, rowers, bikes and spinning bikes are all on their last legs. if the new kit promised for april doesnt materialize, ill have to think about going elsewhere. i also believe that several parked vehicles have broken into recently, which makes me think twice about late evening visits."

3,2023-03-30,Cleanliness Decline,"my husband and i have used the gym for a few years now and we were always impressed by the standard of hygiene and cleanliness, however this has recently taken a noticeable decline. the toilets are often grubby and untidy and the showers need a good clean. there is also a lack of soap dispensers in the toilet with only one shop bought soap dispenser available between all the sinks. it is really disappointing because pre covid we were always really impressed by how clean everything was and it was the first thing any visitors we took along always pointed out. the first floor also seems really crowded with equipment whilst the top floor seems quite empty. it is such a shame cause we really did love the place and now we are not so sure."

2,2023-03-29,Disappointing overall!,"considering its only been open for 4 months, hygiene and cleanliness is really really disappointing.  the cleaner ive seen seems to be on a jolly, and hasnt grasped the job title yet.the websites not being updated with the correct staffing and managerial information.  god knows how the place runs, theres no staff there half the time, and i feel sorry for the ones that are present.  shoestring springs to mind!  plus, staff quality is questionable!  everybody that goes is a pt training their clients, when their own staff have to pay a fee, and people using others key fobs!  its going to be a matter of time before somebody suffers a serious injury from one thing or the other. disappointing overall, especially with some other longer standing and experienced gyms in the area, including the far more reputable university gym (maes glas)."

2,2023-03-29,What was once a great gym is no longer great…,"what was once a great gym is no longer great as its now unfortunately so incredibly busy. i am wasting the membership as i am put off from going. both car parks are often still full at 8.30pm at night & this week all treadmills & all benches were taken pretty much from 8-9pm. people stood around trying to figure out what they can actually do. so disappointed. too many new members allowed to join which means existing members like myself are having a poor experience. and this is not about limiting numbers in the gym at any one time, as this would again mean long-term members would suffer. i sense i would better off paying more to go elsewhere & am considering this if it continues."

4,2023-03-29,It's ok,"ive found puregym to be the best gym chain but its still far from perfect. i wish you could access all puregyms with one membership even if you had to pay extra, but thats not too important. since its targeted for beginners, it has matrix equipment which is pretty bad but still better than technogym haha. overall good enough for me for the price."
5,2023-03-29,Amazing and well looked after gym,amazing and well looked after gym. i go for the classes and highly recommend. for anyone of any fitness level. super friendly staff and welcoming !
4,2023-03-29,Really good but could be better,"having recently joined this gym after being to a number of other gyms in the past year, the first thing i noticed is that the weights (other than the dumbells in the free weights area) are very rarely put back in the right place, meaning that a good chunk of your first set is spent looking for the actual plate or kettlebells. this may just be poor etiquette by gym users and may be because i am there early and no staff are there, but i have been mid-day and early morning and each time i had the same issue. perhaps a member of staff could be dedicated to going round regularly? signs could be put up to show proper etiquette? maybe label specifically where the plates and dumbells should go?  my only other gripe is that there is a lot of wasted space in one section of the gym, which is the open area to the right of the stairs on the ground floor. i am aware that classes take place here, but i feel that this can be sectioned off more efficiently i.e. the area behind the pillars in this room could be used to put a strip of astroturf for a sled to be used, and perhaps this could also accommodate more kettlebells to make it a functional training area? i just feel that the amount this area is used for classes and the area used up vs what could be put there whilst also accommodating the classes is disproportionate. i’m not sure how this would be implemented and even if my suggestion could be heard, but it just doesn’t really make sense to waste so much space.  other than the above, the staff are great, the equipment is great and i would recommend the average gym user to come here."

2,2023-03-21,Not a bad gym BUT,"not a bad gym, can get a little busy at times, which i guess is expected.  unfortunately the showers in the last couple of weeks have been cold, luke warm at best, (you actually dont feel clean after showering anymore) and the shower trays always tend to be full of little hairs, i actually wear slider when showering now becuase of this.  it no longer feels like a gym that only opened around 3 months ago - real shame.  (lincoln carlton centre)"
2,2023-03-28,My experience,"i’ve been going semi regularly for the past three months, and the amount of things i see is unreal.  i’ll start by saying the good points;  they are a 24 hr gym, which suits my schedule well.  they have free weights that are monitored to an extent.  there is an overflow car park which is free (even for the locals to dump there car in).  now for the bad;  there is no limit on memberships, causing the gym to be extremely busy. having to wait for equipment is normal in any gym but it’s unreal the amount of people sat on the machines doing nothing for 10 minutes or taking selfies.  the men’s locker room is too dirty, there needs to be a cleaner coming in halfway between shifts. after the night clean it’s great but just before that there is rubbish everywhere, bottles left out, urine on the floor etc. also, during the evenings the smell of weed is sickly. i’m not talking about a little bit either, it hits you as you enter the locker room.  lastly, i have had sixty pound taken out of my wallet which was in my pocket inside a locked locker! the padlock just left on the side, how they got in i have no idea, but be careful and use a key padlock and not a coded one."

4,2023-03-26,I love the new Pure Gym in St Ives,"i love the new pure gym in st ives, cambs, i have attended on two consecutive nights with my son. the facility is so well equipped and spotlessly clean. my only suggestion in terms of feeling more comfortable as a woman visiting at night is about feeling safe. i would be happier if there  was a member of staff present but failing that it would be amazing if there introduced a buddy system that people could register for to enable them to bring a friend (member or non member maybe for nominal fee) in order to feel safe late in evening. also first night struggled to operate exit system and if in a hurry or worried i felt this difficulty leaving would make me uneasy. however on balance absolutely loved it."
2,2023-03-28,Long term member - run down gym and lack of care,"long term member - gym has been ran down for a while, spacious gym but the equipment choice is outdated, smaller gyms with less income have been refurbed before this one (aintree puregym or widnes as an example). lack of variety of equipment in comparison to these ie. plate loaded machines.  not sure whats taking so long but decided to finally leave until a face lift has been done and join the gym group across the road which has multiple of pretty much every machine, cheaper and more variety as well seeming to care more about their members (6 cable stacks just being 1 example) so youre never really waiting for anything.  put some money back into your busy gyms! itll help everyone from pts having members coming in and increasing revenue for themselves by getting new and returning clients, members having a better time training there and pure itself."
1,2023-03-20,The staff did not know how to talk to…,"the staff did not know how to talk to its clients the janitor was rude and told me she didn’t care that i lost my card(i simply asked her if she saw it and she said she threw it away because she didn’t care) although i understand i should take care of my belongings is that any way to talk to a client who has been going to this gym for years very disappointed,the toilets are also rank , sink smells like sulfer and eggs, weights are always scattered everywhere, studio is always taken up , always changing monthly prices higher , machines always broken and so on i only still go to this gym because me and my friends go together and it’s closest to my house . fix up"

2,2023-03-27,Never mind,firstly need to apologise to the gentleman who saw me.  arrived to see if i could have a quick look around and was told no as a class was about to start and would take 45 minutes. i guess this is spent trying to get you to join. shame really i was in a positive mood to leave my current gym and potentially join.  but after that brief visit and the rubbish traffic to get there i need to remember the saying the grass is always greener. this is the not a reflection on the member of staff who looked awkward sending me away.

3,2023-03-26,Showers stink of urine,"this gym could easily be 5*. and actually the gym is well equipped and the gym area is clean. the staff are friendly and approachable.  the issue with this gym is the shower area. it absolutely stinks of urnine. its not a faint smell, but an absolutely overpowering stench. at first i thought it was just the cubicle i was using. but all of the showers stink. ive only been twice, but i asked an old work colleague that i bumped in to and he said its always smelling. you need to stand outside the showers and turn them on just to wash away what evers on the shower base because they just arent clean. i tried messaging the gym instead of leaving a review but the facebook page doesnt help at all and the email on the broadstairs page doesnt go to them and all you get is a generic reply about emailing the gym manager, but when you follow the instructions it just gives you the same email as before. they really need to be disinfecting the showers a few times a day. and they need to make the local contact information easy to find."
2,2023-02-19,When I joined it said there was no…,"when i joined it said there was no joining fee. but i was charged for this. everytime i attended the gym, there was a notice on entry to say this gym was unstaffed. i would have thought there would be one staff member on reception at least during daytime hours."

3,2023-03-25,NO MOTIVATION,"are classes never changed up? been doing the same saturday spin for months, new music and new routines needed. last weeks spin was absolutely awesome - it was covered by a guy called pavel - he brought so much fun, motivation, great workout - lisburn needs him badly. same with all the classes they are the same and never changed up, it gets boring after a while and doesnt have any stimulation or motivation. also what is the crack with the aircon? always blowing out warm air?! not good for you, you need cool air when all sweaty in a gym, spin and studio rooms are wild for it 🥵😞"
2,2023-03-25,Staff can be really rude,so this can be great as long as there isnt a class on. there are a couple of gym instructors who turn the music up so loud you cant even hear your headphones. i have politely asked a couple of time if they could turn it down but generally the response is pretty rude. this morning an instructor was particularly unpleasant hence the negative review. a couple of other people were going to approach him as well however having seen the response i got decided against it.

1,2023-03-24,Cancel plan,hello.  im having a problem canceling my subscription.  this month i decided that puregym is not for me.  i enrolled at the gym and went to train 2 or 3 times and the gym was always full.  since then i decided not to continue anymore.  i looked several times in the app how to cancel the plan and i didnt find any option to do that so i withdrew the balance from my account that i had registered in the app so as not to do the automatic renewal.  when the renewal date arrived as there was no balance i believed the subscription was automatically canceled but today £46.99 was debited from my account.i would like this amount to be refunded and my subscription finally canceled and i also request puregym to correct the app to make the cancellation easier for the customer and to insert a customer service field.  so you avoided new complaints like this.  have a great day!i believe that if it was not debited on the date it should already be cancelled.  do you understand that this is a glitch in your system?  i kindly request that my account be refunded the amount of £46.99 debited to my account.

1,2023-03-21,first time experiencing racism,i have been going gym over 6 years and never have i been spoken too so rudely by a gym manager in my life. she said i was slamming weights when i have not and been doing the same thing in many other puregyms and thegyms with no hassle. she’s making puregym look like planet fitness 🤦🏽‍♂️  i also witnessed other gym users doing worse but no response to them. i genuinely believe she was racially profiled me as a brown skinned muslim. i say this as she was looking at me funny since the moment i entered the gym. all i’m saying if your a brown skinned asian background you may get an unwanted lecture by daria uniatowska 🫤.  apart from her all the other staff were delightful and friendly 👌🏽. i been a member of puregym for years and won’t change just because of her. i been to many of their facilities from wales to england and all was such a good experience.  edit: i appreciate the quick response by puregym management. again i would like to illiterate puregym in general over the years was amazing and still is so today. it’s just one bad apple in stratford puregym who forced me to give one star as in my life i never experienced such a rude malicious behaviour. the gym itself however is beautiful and great equipment ✅👌🏽

1,2023-03-20,The worst gym in London,"the worst gym in london. no aircondition(only on website). smells of poo in change room all the time, no ventilation. pee on floor the same, all the time. go to the gym manor house(10min difrent), you will love it. and is cheaper"
1,2023-01-24,“SmartParking” PCN received and unable to contact anyone!!!,"“smartparking” is very negative. i rejoined puregym nov 22 and hadn’t realised that i needed to register my number plate when i visited the gym. i tried to appeal the fine, but this was extremely difficult and frustrating as it was impossible to load supporting evidence (photos) to their claim site. it was also impossible to phone them about this! i have received a £170 to park at your gym and is quite a disincentive for a simple error!!!! i am extremely unhappy about this, and they have now taken the parking charge to a debt recovery company. i would like to speak to the billericay manager, but i cannot find the details please help urgently!!!"
5,2023-03-21,Helpful and friendly staff,"i hadnt been to the gym for a while and do have the lovely charlotte as my pt, but still have sessions on my own.  it was a bit anxious at first but i quickly realised staff and members are really friendly. there is always someone to point you in the right direction if youre a bit unsure. chris was particularly helpful this morning explaining a particular lift.  happy with my experience."

1,2023-03-21,0/5 STARS!!  5 months on since my last review nothing has changed!,this placed should be in partnership with costco - kirland bottles everywhere - i visit twice a week and have been 40/50 times and never seen a cleaner.  there has been mothballs of dust in the changing rooms for weeks and they stink - a hole made in the walls in jan is still yet to be painted (male changing rooms).  there is absolutely no care/attention of users or staff to put weights back as they are strewn across the entire gym.  treadmill upstairs nearest the wall has not been repaired after damage months ago - weight machines rusted.... do i need to go on.  i would genuinely love to walk the gym with the manager to understand how this is acceptable.showers are cold and of low pressure -

3,2023-03-20,PureGym - Stratford’s newest teenager social club,"i have been using this puregym since it opened in december and i’ll definitely echo some of the points raised in other reviews.  mainly, teenagers - after about 5pm on weekdays this place is a social club/hangout for 15-18s.. i know some of them are under 16 because of my job. i’m not sure what can be done to rectify this now because they have their memberships but i know people who aren’t going back there because of this having signed up, i’m going to do the same.  lots of the lads can be quite annoying, poor etiquette, hogging machines, being silly (i’ve witnessed 4 boys rolling on the floor sparring and play fighting upstairs), some derogatory about other gym users and the girls tend to just wander around in pairs.. my advice would be go after 9pm, weekends before 10am or weekdays early morning or during the day on school days.  on the other hand the gym is well kitted out, you have room to work out on the floor if needed, good stock of weights and helpful staff."
5,2023-03-20,Pure Gym Catford,the gym equipment and staff are high quality.  there is no shouting or really loud music in the gym and the gym is big enough so that even at its busiest times you can still find the eqipment you want to sork out on.  the icing on the cake is that it is near to where i live.  walking distance.

2,2023-03-20,Useless Customer Service,"the customer service for puregym is genuinely something to behold. i just want to change gym. im happy to upgrade to plus. yet, when i try to do this, the website is unresponsive, the help pages route me right back to the unresponsive pages, and the only way to speak to someone is...via social media? are you saying i have to make a twitter account just to get basic customer service?  no. this isnt acceptable. ive always had a decent experience with puregym venue and such. but when you have a problem, theyre subpar at best."
5,2023-03-20,Very good gym,"very good gym, good equipment and loose weights, friendly staff. only complaint is the ground floor temperature. the other day it was freezing outside and they had the aircon on cooling - why ?? it was far too cold and people were wearing fleeces whilst training"

1,2023-03-20,No support - Not really functional,"the app stopped working for me, i cannot manage my subscription fully through the website. the support wont respond for hours and i have to lose at least one gym day.  all that would be solved if they had telephone support or a more functional app or if you could just do everything through the website without using the app."

2,2023-03-20,Showers are cold,"changing room facilities are unpleasant, especially in the cold weather.....no heating and cold showers. the lack of heating in minus temperatures was awful to the point you had to warm yourself up with the hairdryers, but you could at least have a hot shower. two weeks ago the shower temperatures were turned down so you cant even get a hot shower anymore. if youre wanting to use a gym with hot shower facilities i would not recommend puregym at all.  update: 21/03/23 thanks for the reply, however i have already spoken to the gym manager at fareham and was advised nothing can be done due this being a company wide scheme being rolled out across all gyms. the suggestion was to write a review. going round in circles!"

3,2023-03-20,Gym Issues,"its an okay gym, but its now becoming overcrowded in the mornings to the point its impossible to complete a full weight workout, machines are constantly out of order and stay that way for months & the broken lockers far out number the working ones. it never used to be like this 4 or 5 years ago byut starting to become worse and worse."
2,2023-03-19,i went to Pure Gym Moston yesterday…,"i went to pure gym moston yesterday morning. the one and only assault bike was broken, the seat was all over the place and had no computer. there are only 2 ski ergs and both of them were broken and not usable. there was 4 stairmasters and 3 of them were unusable, 1 of them since december. there is countless other pieces of equipment not in use and broken. this is not acceptable and to be honest a disgrace. i understand that it was a sunday and some can break whilst the gym is unmanned but most of the above has been like it for weeks if not months. i have tried to send messages to the gym or to puregym about this being rectified but the complaints side of things is almost impossible. i am on hyrox programme and need these pieces of equipment and want to know when these will be sorted before i choose to take my custom elsewhere."
5,2023-03-18,It's a brilliant gym,"its a brilliant gym. the monthly membership is the cheapest ive seen. its very clean and has a huge variety of weights, machines and equipment. the staff are always helpful and welcoming.  what would be good though is adding an extra couple of changing cubicles in the ladies changing room. there is only one and most of the time ive been there its occupied."
5,2023-03-19,"Great management, clean & spacious gym","staff make an effort to bring a positive atmosphere to the gym e.g. they decorate for special days/events and often have useful guests visiting e.g. prostate awareness, free health checks etc.  i’ve also not had any issues with lack of equipment etc & it’s a pretty spacious gym also."

5,2023-03-18,Great value gym,"i joined the gym when it first opened. the facilities are clean and the equipment varied. you need to sign up early for classes to be guaranteed a place and the class can vary in intensity depending on the instructor. it is great that they have added yoga (additional charge applies) to the timetable but would be even better if there were midweek yoga classes too. to make it better, i would love a bit of help time to time with my technique."

5,2023-03-18,The 24 hour gym access is paramount for…,"the 24 hour gym access is paramount for those like myself who work erratic hours and who may want to go when less people are there. the array of equipment, number of free weights/plates is ideal for the usual busier times. everyone who i have spoke to in the late, very early and early afternoon hours have been friendly. be it asking to ""borrow"" some of their weight plates or asking when theyre done on a particular piece of equipment."
1,2023-03-19,NO AC,"honestly, the main reason i attend this gym is for the women’s only section. unfortunately, they don’t pay attention to any complaints raised - i.e no air conditioning for three days straight, which i can understand if it was faulty or an error but i was ignored when i raised this in an email.   also it’s very under equipped. you can tell that the focus is on the main gym and the woman’s only gym is just there which is actually borderline misogynistic and super inconsiderate.   it’s a shame because i do like the gym in general in terms of cleanliness, but the lack of attention paid to the women’s only section is quite unfortunate."

4,2023-03-18,4 stars is for the gym,4 stars is for the gym. ill avoid all the usual things and talk about maintenance. i reported the broken lights in the mens changing room about 6 weeks ago. i have reported this to the manager twice now as well as most of the shower door locks being broken for a similar amount of time. the manager assures me they are still awaiting the maintenance team to visit and carry out repairs. whoever is in charge of maintenance is doing a seriously pitiful job. its just 2 light fittings but casts half the lockers into darkness making it difficult to read your combination lock.

5,2023-03-17,Ever since I joined pure gym,"ever since i joined pure gym, it’s been an absolutely fascinating environment. it’s always well kept and tidy with all equipments arranged to be in the proper place. the staffs / instructors are always very much around and active at the same time. everyone around the gym is friendly and people are most likely ready to support you if you need any words of advice or assistance. the rest rooms are great and well kept as well. my only problem lately will be for the gym to improve the heating conditions because sometimes inside the gym is way too cold due to the winter weather, perhaps more atmosphere heaters can be installed to at least reduce the cold temperatures inside the gym. overall, pure gym is very nice and great. all the ones i have used in manchester have never gone below par. cheers."

2,2023-03-15,The ladies toilets were in a bad state,"the ladies toilets were in a bad state. wet floor no hazard sign. the toilets were so dirty with faeces all over the underneath the toilet pans. it appears that they have not been cleaned for a while. the sinks look a lot to be desired, no hand wash with hairs around the sink.  i mentioned it to a member of staff who said he will get a cleaner to come round."
3,2023-03-16,the equipment is not good enough,i am an elite level powerlifter and love this puregym and the community of lifters within it however ive been to many other local gyms and the equipment just cant compete with them ive spoken to many other who just lift for fun and they all agree that the equipment elsewhere is better and they only go because its closer but many of us are considering switching to other gyms with better equipment and thats not just powerlifters but normal people who just want to lose weight or get a but of muscle

5,2023-03-15,Amazing classes and staff,"i have been coming to the classes for about a year and absolutely love it. i had never set foot in a gym before this but the classes have made me learn exercises and techniques. so if you are a beginner never be afraid as everyone is there to support one another!  all the staff are so friendly and chatty and its so lovely to have such a great community. i cannot praise the gym more highly!  gordon windebank (personal trainer) does such fabulous classes. he really pushes you as far as you can and motivates you to achieve your goals that you didnt think you were capable of. he really makes sure that his classes are varied and goes around helping with technique. his boxfit, circuits, spin are lots of fun and he is always so happy to tailor exercises depending on your needs. he is really approachable, supportive and gives you time to ask questions and have a laugh! i am so grateful for his help. thank you!  jamal is another personal trainer who does really great classes. he ensures that everyone is motivated and also ensures that everyones technique is perfect by checking on everyone individually. he does lots of the super early classes and is always full of energy and so positive! thank you so much."

5,2023-03-15,Classes and PT,"when i started at pure gym i only went to the classes as i wasnt confident enough to use the equipment in the gym, i found chantelles classes the hardest and pushed me the most, so i enquired about 1 to 1 sessions. chantelle has encouraged me and helped me in so many ways, im hitting my goals and feeling better about myself......100% recommend 💪"
4,2023-03-15,The staff are helpful and friendly but…,"the staff are helpful and friendly but sometimes you have to hunt someone down. the lower weight dumbbells are usually missing and are only available upstairs, if you can find them. it seems to be quite a busy gym and as such, you sometimes have to wait for some equipment"

5,2023-03-15,Recommended pt…,amazingly good leg session with chantelle today really felt the burn and pushed all the way through the reps. highly recommended for a one to one session with her if your looking to get the most out of your gym goals.
5,2023-03-15,Fantastic Classes,"the east end road branch has good vibes. everyone is there to do their workout. fantastic classes all throughout the day which is fantastic, and a vast variety. literally spoilt for choice. i have nothing negative to say, i have been a member since january 2023, wish i had become a member sooner."
2,2023-03-15,"Used to be great. Needs an update, lacking in comparison to other gyms in the area.","been going to this gym over 18 months and sadly, its going downhill. i dont know if theres a suggestion box, but know a few (especially female) members are feeling the same recently.  the weights area needs an update, especially in comparison to other puregyms and gyms in the area. theres two squat racks, one powerlifting platform, and two smith machines but understandably theyre very popular. theres only four 6ft barbells but they belong to the two squat racks, one powerlifting platform, and one bench press, so you feel bad stealing them. plates are hard to find and usually all over the place. the smith machines are ancient, they don’t even go all the way to the ground.  theres no hip thrust machine like other gyms or any space if you want to hip thrust or deadlift away from a squat rack. youd literally just be in the middle of the space and in the way. even if they invested in a hip thrust bench and barbell pad it would be better than nothing.  womens section has nothing in it but cardio and abductor machines. if the two spaces by the mirrors and two benches are taken, loads of women just have to workout in the middle of the room because theres a big ab mat holder in the only other decent space.  it has the potential to be an amazing gym but needs to be looked after a bit better, definitely falling behind. lately, there has been 50+ people in there from 7-10am, so gets quite busy which is great for peoples wellness but difficult for space. would be great if staff could consider updating equipment/layout."
5,2023-03-08,Great For Beginners!,this gym was fantastic in helping me build my confidence and strength- especially grace who’s classes are always fun and engaging!
4,2023-03-14,"Great gym, only a few issues.","its great that the gym is open all the time, and you dont need to book, it makes fitting in a session much easier. equipment is good, with plenty available. there is lots of space around the machines so you never feel crowded when lifting. my only issue is with the showers. you cant set the temperature and i sometimes like a cold shower after a workout. also they can get grubby later a night. perhaps if they were cleaned just before the staff left, as they are open after the staff leave at 10pm (i think) until 12am when they are locked till 3am."
5,2023-03-15,Superb Preston PureGym,preston pure gym has a lot choice of fitness classes. the gym is clean & the staff are friendly.

1,2023-03-14,Male showers not working again,"male showers not working again. probably 5th time in the last 6 months and this time its been going on for over a week. i e-mailed members service, their suggestion is they can cancel my membership if im not happy. i wonder why they feel customers of a certain demographic are not worth respecting. maybe if it was another branch in shoreditch for example with certain customer base they would get more professional service."
2,2023-03-14,School playground,"i have to echo another review on here, i have had few pleasurable experiences at this gym as it’s constantly filled with 14/15 year olds, you say staff have the right to ask anyone they believe to be under the age of 16 for id, but today at 4pm there were large groups of children in school uniforms roaming around, play fighting, hanging around in groups round the equipment, while i was running on the treadmill upstairs, two girls were on one treadmill filming themselves messing around on all the equipment. really disappointing but if ages aren’t being challenged and kids are allowed to play on equipment then i think i’ll be going to a different gym in future, which is a shame because the equipment, staff, classes and facilities are all brilliant! would just like to complete a workout without feeling i’m back in a secondary school playground…"

1,2023-03-14,Avoid at all costs,terrible. two weeks of being pushed between two departments. trying to give notice to cancel my membership. given a refund figure and still no refund and now the refund figure has reduced. shocking customer service.. no clear complaints procedure.. no one to talk to just awful!! note added after puregym 16/03/23 08:50pmhollow words!! after begging for info on their complaints procedure i am still waiting!!! shocking.  problem still not resolved.... and still awaiting refund arghhhhhh   ps if i could have give 0 stars i would have

2,2023-03-09,Removal of cleaning supplies but increase in membership fee...,"i am really disappointed at the removal of the cleaning station on the ground floor. only one paper towel dispenser has been left at the far end by the free weights. it is insufficient for everyone that uses the equipment on that level and shows no consideration for anyone using the cardio equipment. not to mention can be quite an assault course to grab a paper towel and get back to the other end whilst trying not to disturb, trip over or get hit by people in the middle of their own workouts (the folks using the free weights are by no means in the wrong). i imagine they are just as annoyed by having to watch out for the increased foot traffic.  having asked a few friends who use pure gyms elsewhere ive found this seems to be a hq directive which baffles me. yes covid is now much less of a concern but surely that should have proven how important cleanliness and hygiene is. removing right after announcing a price increase too, not a great look.  please rethink this. its so important to have the ability to clean equipment before and after use.  the gym itself is ok, during peak times there are queues for equipment but nothing i wouldnt expect elsewhere and the staff are very helpful. if i was rating just in those areas my rating would be much higher."

2,2023-03-13,CAR PARK FULL OF LITTER,"staff pleasant and equipment serves its purpose, despite now being a bit dated, but cant complain too much for this price. huge range of cardio equipment which is grand, although that doesnt seem to be replicated with the weights. the lockers however are nearly all broken, the car park is litter riddled and despite all the mentions of this below nobody there seems to give a fig. the soap always runs out in the dispenser in the gents changing rooms and it also has two grotesque yellowey patches under the urinals. one of the two loos has a missing seat and im inclined to day probably isnt cleaned enough due to the state of the cubicles and loos themselves, both on the inside and outside. not sure where these animals come from who use the loos. how is it even possible to be so vulgar??"

5,2023-03-13,Great Gym - Needs a bit of investment.,"i recently moved from warrington north to warrington central having spent many years attending the winwick based gym i was a bit apprehensive about regularly attending the central branch.  i needn’t have worried. the gym is clean, the atmosphere is lively and friendly. beth was a fantastic manager at the warrington north gym and created a very safe space to train in. i am sure she will continue that success here.  i wish some of the cardio equipment would be repaired quicker or replaced with some newer models however there is always access to a machine if you need one.  i am enjoying my workouts and i look to visiting each day."

3,2023-02-19,Improvements required.,"i was very pleased to join this gym as it was very close to where i live and this is why i joined. having used quite a few gyms around london , i think it will be really appreciated if you can make the following changes/improvements 1. there are not enough slots for induction. the max people on induction is 2. i am sure that up to 8 people will be fine. 2. improve hygiene standards in the gym. there are no disinfectant spray and blue roll or hygiene wipes around. unfortunately people sweat a lot and there is no means to clean somebodys else sweat before i use an equipment 3. hygiene in the toilet are really bad. please improve 4. the hand dryer in the toilet doesnt work. i need to press the switch on the wall and the switch off the wall with wet hands. health & safety! 5. the floor on the main gym areas is full of dust , i am sure the cleaners can do better. people leave behind their empty bottles and the next day there are still there. 6. your gym classes luck power and the music on these classes do not match the tempo of the class. 7. please fix the assisted chin and dip equipment, so many people would like to use it but they cant. 8. the members of staff are not helpful when i ask them questions and they never smile. 9. your address says london stratford and then stratford upon avon ( miles away!)"

5,2023-03-13,Pure Gym Blyth Excellent,"i have just taken advantage of the free 3 day pass. the atmosphere is very welcoming and comfortable. also i cannot rate the staff highly enough. just by chance i spoke to the manager about what he thought the best gym plan would be for me. he was very informative and gave me honest opinions on plans, rather than just automatically push me in the direction of the most expensive membership. this experience has made my decision easy, i have cancelled my over priced membership at concordia leisure centre and decided to join here."

1,2023-03-08,My son has been at the gym for months…,my son has been at the gym for months and parks at the car park which is used for the gym and puts a ticket from the gym in his car every time. there is a new company covering the car park and putting parking tickets on lots of cars using the gym. is this car park still available for gym users and are you aware of this company putting tickets on your members cars. as i think you will be losing a lot of business over this and you stated this car park was free to use while using your gym.
1,2023-03-11,Dirty changing rooms…ongoing!,"still issues with cleanliness with mens changing rooms, instead of getting a reply that’ ‘we have new cleaning staff etc’ can we see results and have this actually taken on board by management. it’s all very well giving a response but if nothing gets done it’s the same old same! this is a reoccurring theme which other members have mentioned so it’s not just my perspective!"

4,2023-03-11,I enjoy using this gym,"i enjoy the access, free parking and spaciousness of this gym. i enjoy using the app too which i think is great. i found chloe the manager very friendly and knowledgeable.  i would like to see wifi as im currently using my own phone data at the gym.  id also like to see more classes on low intensity strength training which is recommended for people in my age group ( mid 50s). theres currently a fair bit of hiit type classes which can cause injuries in my age group. i dont think trainers are generally in tune with an older users needs.  a yoga class would also be great.  overall i enjoy using this gym and look forward to future developments."
4,2023-03-11,Great surprise heard different views on gym but on first hand experience a very good Happy gym,great clean well run gym with people of all ages working and training in harmony very impressive
3,2023-03-11,Please review who is running classes,"recently joined and have been attending classes, majority of which run by ed or chloe and have been great, two really enthusiastic, knowledgeable and supportive trainers. however, have had three classes with chantelle and all have been disappointing.  no motivation from her, stood in the corner clock watching, not participating in the class or even demonstrating the exercises, which does not make you feel either confident or safe, she also forgets how many sets of an exercise we have done and the classes have really repetitive exercises.  it’s pretty obvious that she is not interested in running classes and only interested in being a pt with her own clients.  general consensus from this mornings class which she changed from pump to burn it at the last minute, was that we wouldn’t be booking onto another class run by chantelle in the future. which is a real shame as generally the gym is very friendly and seems to have a good mix of people attending classes."
5,2023-03-11,Place and staff,the place is nice and the staff is helpful.

1,2023-03-11,New improved gym experience??,before the refurbishment started the gym was very open and well lighted and a positive place to be after going last night the gym is still half closed off with free weights now upstairs in a small workout area with black walls and zero lighting making it very depressing.. accidents will happen due to poor lighting and how cluttered it is and thats when no one but myself was in there if this is the new look they are going for then i will be going else where as lighting in a gym is important.

5,2023-03-10,Great gym,"great gym, clean, spacious and plenty of machines to choose from"
1,2023-03-10,Be careful with male PTs,"i joined a puregym in london and i hired one of the pts. he was beyond unprofessional and situation got ugly. i reported him to puregym safe space team that claims that they have no tolerance to this. i also reported him to the branch manager. branch manager was super supportive but she realistically could not do anything about the situation apart from talking to the pt about his professionalism. safe space team takes days to respond and the entire issue just drags on way too long considering urgency of the issue. the pt was told off by his manager and now, to retaliate, he decided to fabricate his part of the story, and tried to justify him not delivering the last session nor refunding me, despite me flagging his breach in the contract he created and just decided to steal my money. he also deleted messages that could convict him from his wrong doing on whatsapp when i informed him i will seek a legal advice. he was extremely arrogant saying no one will investigate this and he won’t go to the court. he said that he was calm about the entire thing because he was messaging me in the presence of his manager at that moment which he deleted (although i saved that message). he is clearly a skilful manipulator and the fact he knows exactly what to say and which messages to delete makes me wonder if this is the first time he has done something like this. i am not quite sure what’s the point of the safe space team as they don’t seem to be taking this seriously. my money is forever lost and i feel that they just give a platform to a toxic man to do whatever he pleases saying he is self-employed and so they cannot do much. my horrendous experience which i have voiced is not dealt with with urgency and now i am questioning the genuine intention behind this ‘no tolerance’ that the gym promises. be careful!  update: puregym gave me a refund for my membership. they said they dealt with an issue but they said they cannot disclose how. now, i delivered an official letter to this individual with a standard procedure, requesting money back. if he disagrees, we need to go to the financial ombudsman.  this individual now said to me he will offer me half of the money he owes me, but if i still want to take it to the financial ombudsman, he will report me for sexual harassment. he also says that puregym advised him to take this course of action against me. this is especially interesting as they refunded me, apologised, and also said they cannot comment on the issue between pt and me because he is self-employed. now, they are advising him to accuse me and blackmail me so i am scared to take it to the ombudsman.  avoid this gym, this is the most misogynistic environment where they pretend they care by creating safespace clearly for an abuser they try to protect."
4,2023-03-10,Great place to work out,"great place to work out, easy app to use and all machines work the only fault is the toilets as they smell and often drains are blocked."
4,2023-03-10,The classes have changed a lot recently…,"the classes have changed a lot recently with new pt’s. i am very open to change and seeing new pt’s,  giving them a chance. however, the changes have not been for the better. the classes have been quite disrupted for the worse. less lbt classes. the body pump classes have changed in their format but not for the better. the circuit class tonight and the pump class was the worst i have had at pure gym. nice guy but not a clue about class format etc. i enjoy the classes but recently it has not been the case."

5,2023-03-10,"Helpful, friendly staff",helpful friendly staff put me at ease when i first joined as id not been to a gym for a long time.
1,2023-03-10,Theft Of Belongings,"considering the large number of cctv cameras it doesn’t stop crime occurring.  had my brand new trainers stolen from the locker room, manager and police have been notified. i spoke with a gentleman who was in the changing room at the time and he said someone cut the lock of his locker took his debit card and spent £200+ so it’s clearly not a one off incident if the first person i speak to about it has had his belongings taken too.  don’t bring anything of value into this gym. car keys, wallets, phones. even a locker with a padlock on isn’t safe for 10 minutes in the middle of the day with so many people around.  i highly doubt anything will come of the cctv footage as it only shows people entering and leaving the changing room and can only be narrowed down to say 10 people which isn’t enough evidence to do anything. i will update this review should anything change.  edit: while it may be in the membership agreement of all gyms, any car park you enter and any building you go into that you are not responsible for personal belongings, members should still feel safe and judging from past reviews its not just me feeling that cctv isn’t enough to prevent incidents."
5,2023-03-10,Loads of space and machines,"friendly, knowledgeable staff, loads of space and loads of machines, so not waiting, entrance into the building and using the app is really easy"
5,2023-03-10,It’s a gym,"you can drive there, park, do exercise and leave"
5,2023-03-08,PT sessions with Daniel Lagocki,"coming back from a serious hip injury, i was very skeptical about using a pt but decided to go for it as i wasnt seeing progress working out on my own. i signed up with big dan and i am so glad i did. over a 4 week period he has removed the fear i had about using heavy weights, my muscle mass has increased substantially and i feel so much stronger and move better. he has given me a number of exercise routines to combat my injury and i can now see the light at the end of the tunnel, when i will be back to 100% strength. thanks dan."

4,2023-03-09,"Great gym, good value. Shame about the male manager","overall this gym has lots going for it. nice open space, lots of decent quality equipment and good value for money. gets really busy between 5-7pm on weekdays, but it’s a popular new gym so to be expected.  only drawback is the junior manager (male), he’s rude and condescending. he also likes to pick and choose who the gym rules apply to."
5,2023-03-09,Pure gym? Pure gold!,"the gym is well equipped with good availability of equipment. i do usually go around 2.30 in the afternoon so i can’t comment on evening availability. the changing rooms and toilets are clean, as is the whole gym. staff are friendly and helpful. the attraction for me is no yearly membership and the cost is reasonable."

2,2023-03-09,Filthy showers and changing rooms,"gym is good but the showers need more regular cleaning!! they are so disgusting in the evenings!! today there was hair all over the walls and floor, a used plaster and chewing gum on the floor of my shower cubicle, and this is happening consistently every week. i am getting to the point of considering changing gyms!!"

1,2023-03-08,Terrible (even for a commercial gym),"this will be an interest read for anyone who has only seen pictures online etc and want a genuine understanding from someone who has been there multiple times. this gym lacks pretty much everything. the only strength i can give it is that it’s open 24 hours. firstly, it lacks machines which is fine if it were like most other puregyms and didn’t exceed 220+ people a day. it’s rather funny considering there’s about 3 stretching areas and massive, empty walkways for no apparent reason so there’s plenty of space to add machines. a lack of machines is one thing, but a lack of cable hooks is just embarrassing. honestly, you would laugh if you go there for the first time and realise there’s about 6 cable stacks/pull downs which are simultaneously without hooks, meaning the manager and co clearly didn’t pay enough attention to planning.  secondly, and more importantly, the clear lack of hygiene. someone else wrote a review concerning this and the response triggered me to also write one. trying to uphold a “sustainability” record is not an excuse for not providing cleaning equipment like every other gym does. it doesn’t matter how good you claim your cleaning regiment is, it won’t fix the fact that 20 different people have used the same bench before me and none had access to cleaning tools… i’ll talk about the sinks later.  thirdly, the staff, particularly the manager, lack respect. good luck trying to enjoy a peaceful workout with her around. constantly threatening the entire gym for someone to own up to placing a dumbbell in an incorrect area or what-not. with all due respect, it’s a commercial gym. no one really cares where the dumbbells are placed as long as they’re re-racked, particularly during busy hours. maybe you could get angry at things like this when you fix the basic problems of your gym first like the sink design. the priorities are completely mis-prioritised. i’d be far more concerned with how poorly your sinks are designed that your hand is literally touching the floor of the sink whilst you’re washing (which yes, is the definition of counter-productive as you’re literally re touching everything which has been washed off…)  really bad gym, certainly the worst puregym in the radius. however, if you’re a casual who turns up to a class once a week and doesn’t really interact with any weightlifting equipment, go ahead."
5,2023-03-09,Love it,"love it. trainers are friendly and helpful, the gym is clean . perfect"
5,2023-03-09,Super affordable,"super affordable. never been to a gym in my life... now ive been consistently for 6 weeks, love the classes and super friendly trainers and instructors."

5,2023-03-09,Always a decent workout in Clydebank…,"always a decent workout in clydebank pure. there was a hefty investment in equipment, which was long overdue. this has raised the bar a wee bit & makes a good gym, much better. in 8years nothing substantial was spent, whilst other gyms like paisley & robroyston have been favoured, despite being newer & already better equipped. those gyms must also come with massive rents due to location, whereas clydebank’s rent will be close to not a lot. so what i’m getting to, is that the margins on clydebank are likely much bigger than most of your estate, and we’re grateful that you have finally pumped something back in!"
5,2023-03-09,Being old shouldn't stop you!,"i am a pensioner, i was encouraged by my daughter who already is a new member of pure gym to join.   clare met me to show me around, she was professional and had a lovely personality.  i am now a member and will continue to use pure gym.    age shouldnt stop you!!!! there are no barriers."

5,2023-03-08,Excellent gym,"excellent gym. fully equipped, helpful staff and clean changing rooms"
3,2023-03-08,Shame to get picked on by staff,"this gym is great and well-equipped, busy at peak times but app is great and for the price it’s really good.  the only thing that stops this being a 5 star review is that myself and my partner feel unfairly picked on by one of the staff which is a shame.  i’ve been told i was breaking the rules by not wearing shoes whilst deadlifting, however this is standard lifting practice when you don’t have deadlifting shoes, i can’t find this anywhere in the policy, and there was a woman right behind me who also had no shoes on but she wasn’t spoken to.  my partner went to take some equipment that nobody else was using when a class was taking place (on the gym floor and not in the studio so he didn’t go barging in). the equipment wasn’t going to be used by the class and he made a point of not getting in anyone’s way and the class wasn’t disturbed at all, however this member of staff got annoyed at my partner and said that that entire area of the gym floor wasn’t to be used when a class was taking place, despite the class being held in front of a whole wall of equipment and there being plenty of space to access said equipment without disturbing anyone.  finally, my partner got told it was policy to use clips on the barbell when bench pressing, which i again can’t find in the policy anywhere. it’s also important to mention that not using clips whilst my partner was lifting alone is actually the safer thing to do.  of course, if anyone can lead me to parts of the policy saying that above incidents do break the rules then that’s totally fair enough. however, the tone of the member of staff does not come across well and it seems to be an often occurrence that he will pick on one person and then nobody else who is also breaking that same rule."

1,2023-03-08,place has gone downhill,place has gone downhill despite getting a load of new equipment. people walking around in barefoot unchallenged by gym staff never get near the new training area as there is always a private pt class on there that takes over the whole area and plays their own music

5,2023-03-08,The cleaner in consett gym is so…,the cleaner in consett gym is so friendly and always working so hard - i think he needs more recognition if he doesn’t get it already  i don’t like how the showers doors are transparent i wouldnt use these at all - there should be a curtain blocking off the shower area from been in few as you can see people through the shower
3,2023-02-18,Gym fine but parking system (with SmartParking) is terrible!,"gym generally fine, but outsourcing car park to “smartparking” is very negative. i rejoined puregym nov 22 and hadn’t realised that i needed to register my number plate when i visited the gym. i tried to appeal the fine, but this was extremely difficult and frustrating as it was impossible to load supporting evidence (photos) to their claim site. it was also impossible to phone them about this! it will certainly make me consider my membership going forward. as £100 to park at your gym is quite a disincentive for a simple error!!!!"
4,2023-03-08,Was not to bad,"was not to bad, all thing looks good."
1,2023-03-01,Disappointed,wednesdays was a day i used to look forward to in the gym but now the class change has had an effect on me as im not keen on the instructors who do the class that i can make. im now not coming to the gym enough with the change in times for classes which i used to enjoy doing.

2,2023-03-07,Letting 14/15 year olds into a 16+ gym,"i’m aware there’s a 16 year ago cap. i overheard someone saying earlier children as young as 14/15 are going to the gym as parents are setting them up accounts with fake ages. i know this isn’t something that can be detected easily but it’s pretty obvious that half the capacity in there are underage just by looking at them. the staff are hardly about and don’t bat an eyelid to anyone in there. i’m aware as a business you need the numbers but, i’m sorry to say, it’s not an enjoyable experience. groups of kids gathered around machines not even using them? hanging off of the equipment like it’s a jungle jim. play fighting and throwing punches at each other. leaving heavy weights on the machines and not clearing up after themselves. leaving belongings like shoes, jumpers, bags and cigarettes on the floor in the way of walkways… all that’s just been stated was noticed in an hour gym session that i did?ontop of that it’s also way over crowded in there. surly there’s a cap of how many people can be in there at once. if you went in and did a sweep of all of the the 14/15 year olds you’d probably find the numbers in there would half. overall, may have to consider leaving to another gym which is a shame as it has great equipment, just not enough of it for the capacity :("
1,2023-03-07,Dissapointed.,"very saddened to be doing this as i have been a loyal pure gym goer for the past few years but since the renovations the spinning lessons have been driving everyone mad. theres no door and the music is full blast, genuinely concerned it may be affecting peoples hearing. theres no consideration for everyone else trying to work out. i have my headphones on full blast and i cannot even hear my own thoughts. hope they can at least lower it if not i do believe many of us may end leaving to another gym."

2,2023-03-07,It’s so dirty,"it’s so dirty. changing rooms to treadmills. people not picking up their dirty used tissues.  i’ve noticed a real lack of treadmills, and the ones that do work have issues. it’s really sad as i enjoyed using this gym a good 5/6 years back"

2,2023-03-02,"Alternative gym offer, not worth the email its written on","i received an email from puregym banbury on thursday advising of ""intermittent hot water in club."" the email went on further to advise me that ""you will have access to puregym bicester."" so not having had any further advice from puregym banbury, i went along to puregym bicester. i found that my code didnt work on the doors but luckily, thanks to puregym bicester actually having staff available, i was let in, having showed the email to the staff member. props to him for that! i found puregym bicester to be better supplied with equipment. i completed my workout and left. i checked my phone and i found two emails from amy jubb of puregym banbury, with the message that my pin number doesnt allow access to puregym bicester. i then found a third email advising me that ""routine maintenance has now been completed and hot water has been restored"", signed by puregym banbury cross retail park. its a shame that puregym banbury had good intentions but failed to deliver on their offer. this comes down to staff not updating their customers on the current status of their gym. they update the door code but fail to update their customers. all of which makes their original offer of alternative gym use useless. i did give feedback already to puregym via the app, but have yet to receive a response. if i could rate puregym bicester separately id give them five stars."

5,2023-02-19,Great gym,"the gym is good and has lots of machines to work on. also they’ve got a studio and a weight area which is great. i really love the fact that everything is spaced out. is good to see that you have at least a member of staff which is there and help you with any difficulties people might have. the changing room/ toilets/ showers are alright. i just think that some ladies should be more careful when throwing things around and make sure they clean after themselves even if the cleaner comes at some point and does it for us, however, meanwhile we need to have some manners and be a bit careful :). otherwise nothing else to mention. i love going to puregym so i’ll give a 5 start rating review."

3,2023-02-28,What on earth happened to the dumbbell area? A complete mess!,"im a multi-gym access puregym user and have been going to this specific gym for 6 years or so.  until last year this was the best gym id been to in terms of equipment, tidiness etc (i.e. not saunas and extras like that). not the best puregym, but the best gym (and ive been going to gyms since 1994).  the best things about this gym, compared to the other puregyms in reading was firstly the huge space upstairs that could be used kettlebells, stretching, skipping and stuff like that (and it was all the time). secondly the dumbbells were always tidy. always. rarely did i spot a single weight out of place and if one was, because it was so tidy, a member would correct it. it was pretty much perfect and i took pictures to show burnham gym how keeping a gym tidy is done!  about 7 or 8 months ago everything changed.  in the large open area new equipment cut that area in two. new equipment is great but there was a way to position the cable machines without losing most of the space that so many people used! now if someone wants to stretch in the corner no one else can get a mat and no one can use the vibro plates because its all squashed into one small space. and if theres five people in the area theres no room for anything else, forget all the various body weight activities people used to do there. even if theres not five people theres no room for decent kettle bell workouts etc. the best feature of the gym has gone!  secondly someone re-organised the dumbbells. how they were organised before made sense but no one uses a 10k and 50k dumbbell at the same time. also the dumbbells no longer get tidied up and because the staff dont put the weights back in the correct place the members, even the ones who liked to help keep it tidy, have given up trying themselves. what before was the best dumbbell area ive ever seen in any gym has slowly become a complete mess. on tuesday 28th feb it was the worst id seen it. the care and attention that went into keeping that area perfect just stopped and even if gym users want to put dumbbells back into the correct location they cant because its just all over the place. what on earth happened?  maybe you think this isnt that big a deal but if i spend 10 minutes of my work out looking for the second dumbbell or even the pair then thats 10 minutes im not working out.  its the perfect example of if it isnt broken, dont fix it. basingstoke road was the perfect but someone wanted to fix that and we have a mess. this puregym now its an example of what not to do. even burnham, which used to be really bad, is far better than this gym.  its a real shame! i still use the gym because the equipment is good, nothing wrong with that, so if im training in reading and ill be traveling there in rush hour i go to basingstoke road. but if not then i use caversham road gym instead. yes that gym is quite tight on space but the staff keep it very tidy and i dont waste time looking for dumbbells.  i hope someone returns basingstoke road to its former glory."

2,2023-02-24,Management needs to get on top of a few things,"the ladies toilets are disgusting every morning, no toilet paper, not sure if there is a flushing problem or some people just don’t flush, leaving it a mess. studio room looks like not been cleaned in ages, several times i’ve removed empty water bottles chucked everywhere. mats also need cleaning as full of dirt and previous persons hair everywhere. more cleaning stations required. also very surprised how entrances is not monitored, on several occasions i have seen large groups of teenagers enter the gym where one person scans and the rest just get through while still standing in door way! this isn’t fair for paying customers!!"

2,2023-02-27,Gym on its own is OK,"gym on its own is ok, a lot of equipment and is usually clean. however, while there is a functional area this is not very large and in the last few months happens to be taken by pts running group classes which used to be run in studios. please enlarge functional area or redistribute equipment to studios so pts can use it there. some pts have a tendency to leave equipment lie scattered on the ground and move to the next activity with a client instead of putting it back in place. lastly, airbike is constantly broken since august 2022. i tried to use it recently and while ""it moves"" it is not working properly as handle do not allow for full range of movement"

2,2023-01-01,Too many members,"cancelled my membership after the new year. i guess they got greedy and didn’t set a limit on how many people can join the gym. over crowded even during off peak hours, last time i went was after 10pm on a thursday and i was waiting around for machines - which isn’t ideal as there’s only one of some machines e.g. hamstring, arm curl, shoulder press, one working leg press.  my workout went from 1 hour 15 to 2+ hour’s because of all the waiting around. machines are broken more frequently now too and for longer. just a shame as i actually did like this gym because of proximity but way too many people in there now who don’t clean up equipment and sit on machines all day.  staff also seem very unwelcoming, unfriendly and cold - sometimes intimidating. once got told off for not returning a free weight to it’s rack, but the rack i got it from was full so i had to leave it by the rack on the floor - wasnt sure where the other rack was, wasn’t told either."

1,2023-02-25,Unable to access - no communication given,"i go to this gym at least once a week. today i was trying to access the hope street gym in glasgow and wasnt able to. tried my pin twice and received 2 emails stating i do not have access. i checked on the app under ""my gym"" the gym was not listed. spoke to 2 pt - none of them understand why i do not have access. i havent received any communication advising access has been removed. i asked how do i reach out to send feedback and was told to just reply to the rejection email. the rejection access email is from a noreply box. puregym is it not embarrassing that the staff dont know the contact details of their company customer service contact? i sent an email to the member services inbox - i am still to receive feedback/response. i do not recommend using this gym.  the hope street gym is now showing on my app - do i still have access or not? if i have why was i not able to access today?"

4,2023-02-25,In Crouch End brunch the spots water…,in crouch end brunch the spots water needs attention as two of them were empty and just normal water was coming out of the machine and it’s not free so it’s disappointing. also there is no wifi available which would be fine if the basement area would have reception.
1,2023-02-25,Poor customer service,poor customer service. you can’t even get into the gym with the pin provided and when you try to get any form of help there is none available. in the end i left and joined the ballysillan gym which had actual people available to help which shouldn’t be such a novel concept

1,2023-02-25,Unfinished and no excuses for such a poor state for a NEW Gym!,"clearly, puregym palmers was a rush job and opened not finished and is still stuck in that state...  how does this brand new spanking management head office approved gym fair months on?  -no wi-fi. there is zero signal inside so if you’re a parent that’s on call, or taking work break in the gym, or a local popping in you cant be called on an emergency. they did manage to get wifi for staff though, so there is no excuse not to chase for such a million-pound company with multi million network partnerships to send steve in to fix it asap. any internet service provider have an emergency sla to attend but their fails to be any chasing apart from i sent an email. i sent an email to my biceps but they didnt respond - work for it people!  mysteriously there is no engineer booking date and there isnt even an excuse for this. i have emailed the manager but she stopped responding. in the time puregym plamers green has been setup, i have setup 3 households with internet access to the same openreach provider as puregym and i dont have a high-power business account so whats the excuse puregym? this is fault of the higher powers at head office. this needs to be chased twice a day until there is a booking date but there is no responsibility. if there hasnt been chasing twice a day, fire the person who hasnt chased twice a day. if it has, fire the people who dont take responsibility to book. what an incompetency.  i managed to setup an internet connection. gladys did and shes an oap who has no idea what the internet even is, puregym is staffed and has how many departments? pull your finger out mate.  -some machines don’t have stickers to indicate how much weight you are lifting! after months? come on, put some tippex on the pulley machine. is there an excuse not printing your own stickers to show how much weight it being lifted? there is a print shop next door, literally! where is your budget of 50p to print some paper and get stickers for months? i tell you what, use the bio and the puregym advertisement leaflets to write numbers and stick them on the machine. if i were the manager i would do this and send it to head office demanding stickers next day.  -sweaty machines. ok, so the gym can’t force people to change their underwear or shower. if covid wasn’t enough, you can’t wipe the machines when an excrement-soiled person who hasn’t showered uses a machine, and you see sweat stains you have to touch and sit on and touch yuk!. trust me, in summer, where it’s worse, you will notice. already it smells due to the warm musky temperate - please dear lord above tell me the air con works but you can feel the bacteria and fungus growing due to no sanitary conditions whilst the inclusive radio announced once every 20 mins we at pure gym welcome use to use the cleaning stations and we are inclusive to everyone. well, there is a lie right there - management havent ordered cleaning stations and how can we count on inclusivity from the propaganda on the radio and the reality with our eyes?  -one wall is still chipboard and not painted. that’s how unfinished this gym is. its like working out inside those shed in b&q..oh! talking of b&q, there is one down the road. why not go and get some paint and do it up? you know what, that sickly colour makes my biceps shrivel away and shrink...leave it chipboard, at least i wont have to vomit onto my signals phone whilst the overly loud music and wretched heat makes me feel like im in a lucid nightmare.  -the music has risen considerably to an annoyingly loud level early in the morning playing the same one-dimensional genre. my wearable shows high noise levels if exposed. isnt this a health and safety issue? are people aware the same song repeats on loop again and again? its the most anti motivational trick but intended for 18 years olds. at least mornings until 4pm can you play somethign softer?  -the pec deck / rear fly machine handles are not an equal height. whoever assembled this wasnt much older than the pre-school who do amazing lego buildings across the road.. this isn’t just machine...this is both machines. is there a fix? i have an idea, hire that school kids to make it level. they will do a much better job that the team that left the gym unpainted, unconnected, no cleaning and setup the equipment that is failing and unequal.  -lastly, like other puregym, those signs of equipment out of order are starting to appear for weeeeks without any staff trained on how to tighten a machine. head office, let the gym staff do their job and give them a screwdriver or even a spare screw as its better than waiting 3 weeks for a repair company to travel from manchester to london to tighten a screw and have the machine out of order."
1,2023-02-25,Class Nightmare,theres a class every saturday meant to end about 10:15. every time its extremely disruptive. really loud music over the already playing gym music. people all over the place yelling and using up the space despite there being a literally class area! i had to leave. been a decent place up until this bloody class.
1,2023-02-25,The price keeps randomly increasing,"the price keeps randomly increasing, when i first joined it was “£14.99” then it went up to “15.99+14.99 joining fee” & now all of the sudden it’s £25.99? the gym has changed it prices 3 times since opening up and it’s only been opened for 2 months….  staff don’t even help you out, some of them will even respond “i’m not on shift sorry, one of my colleagues can help”.  i’m not joining back again, they’re clearly in it for the funds.  edit: the gym has been opened for approximately 2 months. the presale was only available for one day for £14.99 as i joined the next day and the price increased to £18.99.  now its £25.99?  the machines barely work for the price were paying."
3,2023-02-19,I have been enjoying the gym and even…,"i have been enjoying the gym and even upgraded my membership so my husband can come as a buddy. however, it is getting harder and harder to find a 45 min spin class in the daytime. all my regular classes are turning into body tone/sweat 45. why change a class that is constantly oversubscribed? talking about tue lunchtime and friday 0905 mainly. the gym seems to be trying to appeal more to the people who work office hours and daytime users being forgotten a bit!"

2,2023-01-30,Poor Customers service and Failing equipments,"i was  disappointed to find  that the response to my review was a generic feedback sent to everyone who took time to provide feedback to pure gym. this is rather poor customer service and very uncaring on your side on the genuine issues your members are facing at pure gym in sydenham. its been over 4weeks now where there has been no hot water at this gym, the  management know about this and nothing seem to be done about this. my membership was cancelled because my direct debit failed and  within two days my pin was stopped and i was required to re-join, paying new joining fees. yet a whole month of not providing the services that was promised from pure gym, i receive a generic email and passing me off to gym management who already know about this and have blamed the corporate management for the delay in repairs. i hope they can read this and offer members some compensation as this is very poor service levels."
4,2023-02-16,Hunslet is a great gym,"hunslet is a great gym. instructors are great and gym is spacious. my only gripes are the the following. cleaning not always great. i can get in the shower on a tuesday morning and see a ton of hair on the walls, the next morning, same shower and hair not moved. it’s in the shower so presumably clean hair.  i had to work over monday and missed my circuit class. it was too late to cancel by the time i realised and i got the telling off i so deserved via email with the warning of bans. then tuesday morning i was booked on a class and the instructor didn’t come in. no email cancelling.  not unique to hunslet but 4 hours isn’t enough time for genuine reasons when the gym don’t need any reasons to not do a class when you’ve turned up.  generally love the gym and staff though. classes are great and spencer drives you particularly hard. makes sure you get a good workout.  great team and great gym."

5,2023-02-23,Great Gym and Staff,"staffs are great & lively, the cleaner always cleans the stations and hoovers the floor, and the hand sanitizers are always refilled. cleaning stations never runs out of tissue and cleaning liquid. staffs were also alert - last night all staffs were running around to see the cause of the fire alarm - nothing serious though, maybe a false alarm. good management - should be emulated by other branches."

3,2023-02-19,Mixed reviews,"been a member for several months now and use both the gym and attend classes, and as a whole its not too bad of a gym. quite a busy gym at certain times as expected. a lot of people in there seem to not have much respect for the equipment which results in defective items. on several occasions myself and my wife have been there to do spin classes and several of the bikes have been defective. they dont seem to be in a hurry to repair or replace. seems to be a regular occurrence aswel that classes get cancelled or instructors are changed at the last minute. some of the instructors are very motivational and others just seem to be going through the motions to get to the end of a session. we use this gym because of the location to home and the monthly cost with no contact. if there was one even closer for the same price i would definitely change, although have even considered sacking it off altogether and doing it at home."
5,2023-02-24,I been visit few UK gyms,"i been visit few uk gyms, and puregum is my favorite one"
4,2023-02-22,A great addition to Stratford,"really friendly staff who try to keep the gym clean and tidy - although they shouldn’t have to as people should put their own stuff away! the induction was really helpful and the range of classes is slowly growing, which provides good variety. good value for money considering the equipment and classes available. a small point, but the preloaded barbells are in a strange place. there is no room to use them (particularly for lower body) by where they’re stored. it would be good if they were moved closer to the functional area. i have not tried going in the afternoon/evening, but from the app numbers it seems very busy so that does put me off trying a later workout as i would be concerned that it would be difficult to use some machines. however, i tend to be able to use everything i want to when i go early on a weekday before work or early on a weekend."
1,2023-02-19,Not enough machines,"not enough machines, only 2 bench presses i need to go somewhere else for the best use of my time,"
2,2023-02-19,Uncomfortable environment,"i didnt like that there was no warning about a male handyman working in the women only room. i do understand that sometimes there is no other option but the surprise made me feel slightly ambushed, especially when he brought another male member of staff in and had a long discussion with him right in the middle of the room - to sum up it made me feel very uncomfortable.  also, the vending machine seems to be malfunctioning as i had to pay for one of my drinks twice, since the first time it wasnt dropped, so i was already in a fairly bad mood before i entered the workout room."
5,2023-02-24,Give it a try.,"so glad i took a chance and signed up at puregym burgess hill. i always find it very difficult to stay motivated to go to the gym but am absolutely loving the many and varied classes there, all taught by friendly and helpful trainers."

1,2023-02-22,UTTOXETER PURE GYM - DIABOLICAL ASSISTANT MANAGER  !!,"unfortunately i can not give this facility more than one star which is for the adequate parking/easy access to the gym and the fact that jess has always been polite and helpful.  unfortunately i have had dealings with a lady called chloe at the club and have found her to be extremely unhelpful, obstructive and unable to resolve simple issues having given her several opportunities to do so.  the club also seems to have several closures. i would not recommend pure gym in uttoxeter mainly due to the extremely poor customer service received by chloe.  also there is too little space, equipment,  wcs/changing facilities to cater for members and also frequent club closures."
4,2023-02-19,Nice and friendly staff very…,"nice and friendly staff very approachable. only negative, sometimes the anti bac sprays are empty. recently received an email to say gym was closed due to unforeseen circumstances until further notice, i never received an email to say the gym was back open."
1,2023-02-24,Hidden reviews on google,"i left a google review online asking about the fact there isnt a cleaning station when they both advertise online and in the gym that they have at least 1, and have rules stipulating the equipment is wiped down. i had a response from the manager saying they wouldnt be providing one since covid is over and its damaging to the environment.  my review has then been flagged as spam or a fake experience and no one other than me can see it.  also 3 out of 4 elliptical cross trainers have started coming loose on the right hand sides, so you can feel it wobbling from side to side as you are using it."

1,2023-02-16,Edinburgh craigleith,"edinburgh craigleith  lack of equipment. far to busy. weight machines and free weights need to be in the same space, not split across 3 floors. to many cardio machines taking up unnecessary space. mostly all cable machines were broken, which isnt good enough. lack of squat racks and 20kg bars. massive unused space in the middle of the bottom floor. complete waste."

3,2023-02-17,More woman led classes needed,"it’s been a few months and it’s a great set up, with solid machinery and live count number viewable on the app.  1. the air conditioners need to be better, stronger, high powered. there’s a heavy humidity in the air so the sweat smell from the last person clings to the machine after use. 2. some machines are in use pretty consistently. it would be a good idea to get another leg press machine. 3. i know i attend to a mixed gym - i’m aware and have no complaints about the shared space. people are respectful. however, i would really appreciate female-led classes which seems to be rare particularly in classes like pilates/yoga that are full of majority women participants. i’ve checked and presume this is because bayswater staff are largely men so by no means am i propagating otherwise. but even a shared yoga class alternating between a woman/man each week would be great."

3,2023-02-23,Pure Gym is a friendly gym for all…,pure gym is a friendly gym for all levels male and female. in the whole it is very reasonably priced. downsides are that recently maintenance has been well below par. also current management team is not managing the members in a strong way. e.g. too many members not putting weights away and/or hogging weights. members on machines spending way too much time on their phones between sets. certain members slamming heavily weighted barbells down onto the floor between sets of clean and jerks/ deadlifts etc.

5,2023-02-19,GREAT GYM,"you have everything one could want in a gym as well as a great location, clean space, updated equipment, easy parking, nice locker room, great staff!!!"

4,2023-02-19,My opinion on Puregym is good,"my opinion on puregym is good, i have a few comments, i know there are shortages in the staff, but you should check the toilets more often, especially the mens one, my husband pointed out the dirt in the toilets several times. there are no disinfectants and paper towels. im in the gym 5 days a week and most people are definitely under 16, the age of people should be more verified. classes are very great, friendly, very nice staff. in general, its good at the gym, i think that a few changes will be even better, the most important are disinfectants and keeping order, especially now when there are so many cases of covid. thank you and best regards"
3,2023-02-18,The management of the Empire West…,"the management of the empire west puregym is excellent. however, the chains decision to replace all weight machines with an inferior brand is a disappointment. in addition, there is only one of each machine, even the most commonly used ones, unlike the previous setup."
3,2023-02-19,If you can get in there in the…,"if you can get in there in the mornings, or when its quite, then it is a good gym. unfortunately at stratford-upon-avon if the teenagers are in there they are just a pain. they hang around the machines not using them, getting in the way. they create a mess by dropping their wrappers or bottles all over the place and they break the machines because they cant lift up the weights!! if they could introduce an age restriction of at least 21, it would be great!"

3,2023-02-19,I love the whole concept of pure gym,"i love the whole concept of pure gym. however if i am honest the lay out of my current gym is not that great.  you cannot access the lift unless you are disabled and for me a man with lots of weight on and low confidence i struggle the stairs all the way to the top floor just to drop my bag off. it would be nice that all customers had the ability to use the lift.   i also feel the layout on each floor isnt right. the free weights floor is right at the changing rooms which i find is for more of the vast regular users and can be a little off putting for someone overweight or new to the gym.   i feel that floor should be where you can do your cardio with other like minded new customers.   any interaction i have had with the staff (which has been little) but thats on me, has been really good. always smiling and you can tell the love thier job & have a great passion for it."
2,2023-02-17,The McDonald's of gyms,"for some reason, i dont see the london camden town gym on the list.  anyway, where do i start?  theres black mold in the showers. thats a health risk.  the toilets are often in terrible shape. recently, i came in on a tuesday and every single toilet was out of paper. how does that happen? seems like this wasnt checked upon for days.  more generally, lowering membership prices, dropping the joining fee, and offering ""bring a friend"" to the gym membership drives alienates your current members. why did i pay more for my monthly membership to have the gym crowded full of non paying people that overflow the facilities once every few months? where is the benefit for current members to put up with a weeks hassle and inconvenience of not having space to move in the locker room during a membership drive?  in short, the quality of cleanliness at pure gym camden has definitely declined since i have been a member. in addition to this, there is no benefit to me when you make incoming members pay less than i did to join. buy better marketing and market to a demographic that has the money to join and doesnt trash the place."

4,2023-02-19,Great Gym,"the gym itself is great! lots of space, equipment and variety. the staff are friendly and don’t interfere trying to get a class booking out of you.  changing and facilities are nice. my only complaints would be groups of students gathering round equipment and loitering/vaping in the changing the rooms.  apart from that it’s a great place to work out or socialise in the toilets with tutti fruiti cloud chasers."

(like treadmill she just “cleaned” stop and go buttons)  the hand blow dryers never worked in female changing room toilets, the water pressure downstairs is barely filling up the bottles when upstairs in female changing room it’s impossible to wash hands and leave yourself dry. then other thing there is no sanitising station in the gym!!! how is possible that?! and small things like scale and fat measurement machine and big mirror in female changing room to have in a gym would be really lovely."

2,2023-02-19,So busy at 5-7pm,so busy at 5-7pm. the equipment is good if you can get to it. the classes require 4 hours to cancel or you get locked out of classes for 8 days which meant i rarely got into classes. i left the gym for these reasons

5,2023-02-19,Enough equipment to cater for all…,enough equipment to cater for all needs. im in my early 50s and feel comfortable in this gym compared to the last gym that i was with which was very clicky.
5,2023-02-21,Worth it just for the classes alone!,"i recently joined the gym, and only use it for classes in the evenings and weekends as that is what i was looking for. i must say the classes are excellent, they are all different and really work you, whilst having fun which is so important. the trainers ed and chloe are particularly excellent. ed’s enthusiasm and pure excitement for the classes means you can’t help but enjoy them! chloe is also fantastic, really encouraging whilst making you push harder and keep going without patronising and is a great class leader. another lady had joined for the same reasons as me and echoes my review 5*"
2,2023-02-18,Disappointing and overpriced,"honestly its quite a dingy gym. no windows and an air conditioner that blasts cold air right above the floor exercise section, its bad for you. at any given moment there are at least 3 out of order machines, the row of cycling machines have all been broken for weeks now. theres an unsightly leak coming from a ceiling pipe which has been communicated via email to all customers, but the fixing date has been delayed over and over again. the staff seem alright but not particularly friendly or helpful. the tv screens are often off/broken. i was excited to start pilates for the first time ever but theyre an extra £4 per session! upon registering with puregym it says all classes are included!! for £35 a month its all just disappointing and frustrating. 2 stars are for the variety of machines and convenience of access to the gym itself, the app although slow has lots of features too."
3,2023-02-22,Free parking,free parking! ive noticed that many customers are complaining about free parking. the car park is colour coded for pure gym and players lounge. if you park in the players lounge car park and do not register or number plates at reception then you will get a fine. many customers of players lounge complain that the car park is full when the venue is empty. this might explain it.

3,2023-02-17,Late Night Gym-Goer,"(disclaimer i visit the gym late normally, baring the occasionally pre workday visit. typically 10pm-2am). the gym is fine. some equipment feels outdated to use whether it be creaky treadmills with broken fans, missing screws in some of the machines (eg the lateral row) and attachments for cable machines (rope especially) needs replacing. the lockers also need a refurb as some are broken. staff are generally friendly and keep to themselves unless approached, classes seems to be low attendance which i don’t like and haven’t therefore booked any.  the location can be off putting, as the outside smells strongly of urine and i have found either drunk people passed out or homeless people inside the stairway leading down. none are aggressive, but passing through a cloud of urine and smoke while a man groans on the floor (if it’s a late gym visit) is off putting on entry and/or exit.  there’s the standard problems with some of the people who use the machines being possessive but that’s outside the gyms ability to control.  good points: lots of bikes and treadmills and i have never struggled to access one. variety of machines for strength training which generally good placement around the gym, large studio space of stretching/cardio/etc. music plays but is quiet and doesn’t play so loud i can’t hear through my earpods. it’s clean, as much as a gym is ever clean. changing rooms are a good size. good space around machines to get around the gym and not get in peoples space."

3,2023-02-18,Improve showers,"gym itself is okay, always clean and staff seem rpesent and friendly. good breadth of equipment, although a punch bag would be a nice addition. main issue is the showers, theyre barely warm, rubbish pressure and a 30s timer. genuinely brings the gym down so much not being able to have a decent shower after a workout."
4,2023-02-17,Good gym,stirling is our home gym however we have the multi use membership and have used others. my favourite is glasgow bath st as it is bigger and has so much equipment however i do like the stirling one too and use it more often than i thought i would.

1,2023-02-18,I already changed the payment date to…,i already changed the payment date to the 28th of the month and you still keep taking money on the 20th and then i end up paying extra admin fee whatsoever
5,2023-02-18,Feels like home!,i regularly attend both spin and circuits at bristol union gate puregym. i have never once felt awkward or like a total beginner. the classes are both challenging and adaptable! i have started attending this gym more frequently due to it being close to my office and i found the staff much more approachable then the ones in bath. everytime i come to a class the pts always say hello and it always feels good when they remember who you are and acknowledge your efforts! a big thank you!

3,2023-02-17,"Great gym, bad showers","great gym, awful showers… the water is so hot it literally burns my face. i’m quite pale but if i have a shower there i come out looking sunburnt 😒. it’s a shame because i use the gym late at night around work and caring for my daughter… the benefit of the late nights at pure gym was so i can go after she’s in bed and workout, shower and dry my hair. i’ll be cancelling soon and looking for another gym with better showers"
2,2023-02-22,On 3 occasions in the past 7 days there…,"on 3 occasions in the past 7 days there has been sweaty blue towel left in the bottle holders on the stair climber. monday there was blue towel and someones chewing gum, that had been chewed. disgusting! also the machines seem to have stale sweat on them. do these machines not get cleaned at the end of each day?"
3,2023-02-18,Dislikes,liked floors access to gym and amount of machines available and easy to use equipment  disliked no boxing bags available at all and lack of gym accessories like ropes and no battle ropes available and sometimes machines are faulty

5,2023-02-21,Lively and inclusive gym with fantastic classes available!,"as a regular attendee of the classes puregym haverhill offer, i have to say theyre simply brilliant. the atmosphere is so energetic and inclusive and ive made so many connections with people through the fun, fast paced and challenging classes. one particular instructor who stands out is edward bedbrook. his tuesday classes back-to-back are brilliant and have massively helped me on my fitness journey - i wouldnt miss them! the gym itself is always incredibly clean and hosts a wide variety of modern equipment. people are so friendly and willing to assist whenever, it has really reduced any anxieties or reservations ive ever had about joining a gym. could only be slightly improved with more space - a second floor for more specific areas like female-only or heavy lifting. besides that 10/10 would recommend! :)"
4,2023-02-18,The lockers could be a bit more robust…,"the lockers could be a bit more robust !!  particularly bad is only 1 leg curb machine in the whole altrincham gym. its always occupied and sometimes with selfish people reading their phone. need more of these machines and less of the ones that are empty, please."
2,2023-02-17,People leaving weights scattered around…,people leaving weights scattered around everywhere. puregym must be stricter in their punishment of people leaving weights out in the open. safety hazard as well as inconvenient. also possibly limiting the amount of people allowed in the gym at one point. on my most recent visit the free weights area was super busy to the point i had to spend most of my time waiting for a machine/bench to be free.
3,2023-02-18,It’s alright could be alot better,pure gym york clifton moor i like that’s it’s 24/7 although you were closed christmas i like that it’s heated perfectly down side machines constantly broken or in need of maintenance if i train around 3pm it’s so busy literally there’s not enough weight to go around you can forget about heavy leg presses there’s not enough collars for bars it can be hard to get dumbbells on the lighter end of the scale i have to queue for machines specially leg machines there is no seated calf press either the grass area for the sled is used as storage for equipment or people do exercises on there that they could do anywhere in the gym or you hold classes on there so it’s not usable during this time so i never get to use it for lunges i have to risk the harder surface the soft grass is better for my feet and knees if i did have a balance problem but it’s softer for other people to sit on and their butts are more important i guess machines are constantly left with weights on from previous gym users even though it’s against your rules i’m not just talking about 1 or 2 machines some times your not sure if they are being used or not i had to complain about a dirty nappy right outside the front doors that was there for a week! your staff had to walk past it to enter and the general rubbish the car park should be clean there’s no excuse for the filth it could be an awesome gym but it’s just poor i know it’s cheap but i’d happily pay more for an upgraded gym that just has some love and care to detail but your the only gym in the area closest to me if another gym opens up closer i would move

3,2023-02-18,Anytime I went it was way too busy &…,anytime i went it was way too busy & not enough workout machines for everyone. more space is needed for the amount of ppl that go their.

4,2023-02-22,Great New Gym,"great new gym, the weight area is great size, good selection of equipment, although it was missing a lat machine. the cardio area does seem a bit small, has all you need but i can see that getting quite crowded as time goes on. the men’s changing rooms/showers however needed a clean, considering it was less than 24h since it opened there was fluff/hairs in all showers, not an appealing sight,  hopefully just teething issues. also i couldn’t see any cleaning stations like they have in city centre. this would be a good addition to make sure people wipe down equipment after using. no one wants a sweaty bench!"
3,2023-02-18,I like to be able to use the gym at any…,i like to be able to use the gym at any time but i feel there should be a check done on how many lockers are locked with peoples locks buy there not in the gym also the showers seem to need cleaning regular or more to cope with how.much there used

1,2023-02-18,"You can’t fault the PureGym model, but the interaction with staff is appalling...","you can’t fault the puregym model, the variety of machines, classes, free weights and the app with exercises, nutritional tips and the little indicator that displays how busy your gym is. not only is the app a great use of technology, but the product is fantastic value for money.  sadly any human interaction with the staff or customer services is appalling!!!! if you have an issue, good luck in trying to sort that out.  i recently had an issue at my local gym, discussed it with the gym manager, who was (to be honest) less than helpful!!! i tried to escalate, but there’s no escalation process. instead, you get a stream of automated emails and stock responses from staff when you finally get through; it feels like theyre just not interested, so i gave up!!!!  in summary, the puregym model is, without a doubt, a 5-star!!! however, any interaction with staff or customer services, its a zero!!!"

3,2023-02-13,"Windowless studio, crowded classes","the classes are crowded, too many people are allowed to book for each class. the class studio has no windows and natural lighting which is very depressing. some (otherwise lovely) instructors turn the music way over the enjoyable level and they even overshout it, making the classes rather disturbing than relaxing. im sorry for that but this quality and experience is not as expected."
4,2023-02-18,All the classes are amazing,"all the classes are amazing, clean space, only thing is that the instructors are always late from the classes. also i always have issues with the app. i uploaded already couple of times but didnt help. other than that lovely gym."

1,2023-02-18,False advertising and poor management,"false advertising, and poor management in woolwich said it was 24 hours took my money then wasn’t told management, and they said as a premium customer if you can use another gym, you should but rude to be fair and isn’t 24 hours neither so"
5,2023-02-21,Excellent experiences,"we visited the gym for the first time and were made to feel very welcome by a particular pt named josh and we now attend the gym at least 4 times a week and have 2 personal training sessions a week with him and he also guides us when we are there without him. he encouraged us so much even when we are convinced we cannot do it and made us more determined to continue and achieve our goals. he has to put up with our moans and groans and does it with total professionalism without any discrimination at all. he is a very likeable person and will do very well with his career as he gains more experience. as an older person who has not been inside a gym for maybe 30 years, he has encouraged and supported me...the gym and the clientelle are very welcoming so thank you...i hope i continue to enjoy my time there and achieve my goals."

4,2023-02-17,Great gym for the price compared to others double the price.,lots of equipment and its kept in good condition. when seats or grips start to wear theyre replaced. good range of classes to choose from. only small negative is the scooshers for wiping down the machines need filling up more often.
2,2023-02-06,Wi-Fi connection.,"had joined / booked this gym even before it had opened in dec 2021. when it did start, the staff had said the wi-fi connection may take around 4 months. took a break from the gym n restarted around october 2022. still no wi fi."

1,2023-02-18,Keeps shutting with no regard to customers,i was prompted to rate my puregym again about five minutes before they shut it for maintenance whilst giving me 15 minutes notice. they upgraded my membership so i can access other gyms in the meantime but since they have done this before i know that they will revoke the upgrade the second that maintenance is finished. basically providing the absolute bare minimum for my money. the maintenance work has been needed for over a month and my gym has been without water and working showers since then. the gym facilities themselves are decent but my experience has not been.

4,2023-02-17,This issues needing resolving minus that great gym,the gym has a good vibe and is nice and clean the showers good do with a bit more attention as theyre often broken or the plug holes blocked  things that let the gym down are in the studios members arent able to turn on or off the lights because theres no light switch  if a class is started on the computer screen outside even if no one is in there doing the class members arent able to go in the empty studio and do our little workout in peace  instead youve got to listen to a les mills class while trying to meditate and do yoga in an empty studio  ive trained at puregym portsmouth and these issues arent present with the studios there so i am surprised as to why this is the case at north harbour because of this i am not able to give five stars as the review which is a shame

3,2023-02-21,Too many young kids that end up in this…,too many young kids that end up in this gym makes it look tacky because of the price. using the place as a social club. always busy can’t use most of the machines too. equipment not always put back and showers not always clean.
3,2023-02-18,Cleanliness,"as a positive, the gym has a huge amount of equipment especially compared to other gyms in the area and the layout is great. the downside is the gym is always dirty. the female changing rooms are so bad i try to avoid even going in there, even the gym equipment has rubbish and tissues around it every single visit. i first joined when it opened and it was super clean all the time but now unfortunately standards have slipped and the cleanliness is a major downfall."

3,2023-02-18,Extremely busy yet new gym,"negatives: -extremely busy even off peak. impossible to book more popular classes a week in advance as most pay extra to book classes two weeks in advance. when you are booked there is hardly any space on the floor. feel sorry for staff as they have to put up with it. -car park is tiny, off peak i struggled to get parking space so allow extra time to find parking then walk to gym - only one hand dryer in womens toilet which seems very strange considering how busy this gym gets. -takes forever to get response to an online chat  positives gym is new which i liked staff is good the app is good"

4,2023-02-18,A humble review about Puregym,"the biggest reason on why puregym is mostly superior to most gyms, is that it runs for twenty four hours every day. which makes the gym extremely flexible, even for certain individuals who do not have enough time to spend. although the gym sometimes is packed, you can always find a method to finish a workout."

2,2023-02-17,Could be amazing. Unfortunately falls short.,positive first-new manager (at least i think he is new) making a real effort with the gym. positive attitude. always grinning. as part of new refurbishment number and quality of lifting stations (deadlift squat olympic) increased. after refurb changing rooms far more pleasant. negative-staff often absent. i can be there for 2 hours and not see a staff member on the floor. far too many of members lacking basic gym etiquette. put your weights away. let people jump in. don’t swear at people. staff never on hand to call members on it. toilets always smell of urine (again members!). functional area so much worse after refurb. possibly now less space for functional area. far too much space dedicated to useless machines. you don’t get fit/strong using a crunch/abductor/bicep curl machine.
1,2023-02-10,The gym was really great,"the gym was really great, until one of the trainers was very rude, disrespectful, and discriminatory i felt. really threw all my other great experiences out the window.  i emailed the manager, but didnt get any apology. but said she would look into it."

3,2023-02-21,The gym itself is fine when not busy,"the gym itself is fine when not busy, the layout of the equipment is not great. unfortunately there is very limited car parking spaces on-site and this can be very frustrating when all you want to do is train. for this reason i cancelled my membership and moved to the gym group which has ample parking spaces."
3,2023-02-17,My experience has been good so far…,"my experience has been good so far apart from my last visit on 19/2/23 at boston lincolnshire pure gym. both toilets were blocked and not flushing, then to make things worse, i got in the shower after my workout, pressed the on switch had one short blast of water then the water stopped. the other 2 showers were the same. i had to get dry with an unwashed hair and body!! wasn’t impressed as had to go home and shower! other than that i have been enjoying the gym but do get concerned that people using the equipment are not wiping down after use!"

1,2023-02-21,would raise this with Gym staff but no…,"would raise this with gym staff but no one is ever around.  gym showers - male gym showers are either faulty, not working or cold. many of the showers dont have enough flow to give a shower, just a small tiny stream of water with lots of air. gym management are in denial that there is anything wrong with them, but enough members complain about them. 2 showers give an adequate shower but only on the small chance there is some hot water (shame they are all very dirty.... gym staff used to clean regularly by pouring cleaning solution around through out the day, this was removed since covid :s )  parking - parking continues to be an issue and has been for a number of years - but getting worse at the moment, gym management commit constantly to resolving the issues, but no action is ever taken - like many members have suggested, something as simple as noting reg numbers down and reviewing 4 hours later would stop people using it as their workplace parking. or get a parking eye or something, too many members cannot use the gym because of people using it for work, football or rugby parking - its becoming an insult to pure gym members that this has not been sorted after promising regularly."

2,2023-02-17,Gym is more like a youth club,"when i had signed up, i was not aware that the age to use the gym was from 16yrs. unfortunately, with having such a young age group attend, most adults find that its like a theme park waiting to queue up for a ride. to many teenagers in groups meeting at the gym for a chat and treating it like a youth club and not what its purpose is for being a place to get fit and exercise."
5,2023-02-17,Value for money great service clean…,value for money great service clean everything very helpful staff
4,2023-02-17,Busy and lazy (ironic!),"nice gym but busy and a lot of people don’t re rack weights so during busy times it’s hard to tell whether equipment is free to use or not. saw a pt watch someone just leave weights on the other day, need to be stricter."

3,2023-02-17,Price is good but usually around 150…,price is good but usually around 150 people training at one time which means you often don’t get on the equipment you want which leaves sessions inconsistent or lengthy. i have been a member 2 months and have so far only got to use the cable crossover once and that was 5.30am. more fts stations would help as would more leg machines!

4,2023-02-19,The ins and outs of puregym,"puregym is a great gym for new starters, the range of equipment is great, the vibes and energy is great, if you are a more of an experienced gym rat you can find ways to elevate machines and cables, use the equipment to your advantage. the gym is a playground, try new things and don’t worry about other people thinking things or staring because the more you go the more you will realise no one cares! pure gym is the best place for unbothered people that just wanna feel that pain to know their gain."
5,2023-02-17,Fantastic facilities - limited class access,"fantastic facilities, friendly staff and intuitive app which lets you know how busy the gym is. if you are looking to utilise the classes on offer, you will have to upgrade to a plus account, as there aren’t any spaces for any classes left for basic members (not one space in the past 4 months)"

3,2023-02-17,PureGym Woolwich Critiques,"i currently train at puregym woolwich and for the most part its okay besides a few things.  1) theyve switched from 24 hours to opening times due to noise complaints and the membership is the same price. the service we pay for includes the freedom of coming at any time. so if youre going to reduce what we get, also reduce how much we pay.  2) the gym is supposed to open at 6 am and some staff members are only coming at 5:58 am and as a result the gym opens late.  3) not a complaint but it would be a great improvement if the gym invested in quick release bar collars."

1,2023-02-20,Eldon Gardens: Absolutely Filthy,"the place is filthy. cleaning stations rarely have any soap in them for wiping down equipment. soap dispensers are regularly empty or broken and complaints about the broken ones just result in them being removed.  the equipment is pretty dirty too. one of the bike machines has had crushed up protein bar chunks in the cupholder for over a week now.  mens toilet are gross too. the other day i saw a staff member walk in the toilets and sign the board saying they had been checked. they then walked straight back out without addressing the fact there was literally poo smeared all over one of the toilets and dirty tissues had been thrown everywhere.  if youre up for catching the latest covid variant or a fungal infection from sweaty, grimey equipment, then pure gym eldon gardens is the venue for you."

1,2023-02-13,"Filthy showers and changing areas, broken machines.","the biggest issues are cleanliness and items and exercise stations not being repaired or replaced. it is the lack of cleanliness which disappoints most however. piles of rubbish are often left outside changing rooms. the showers are often filthy and there is mud on all the stairs, changing areas by lockers and even on some machines. the toilets are often unusable and there is no obvious attempt to rectify the situation.  regarding machines which are out of order, they are often left for weeks with out of order stickers on. indeed, even the main electric entrance doors are out of order and have been for weeks, meaning there is only one entrance in and out.  this gym has only been open for barely 3 months. if this is how the facilities are to be maintained, the future at sevenoaks puregym doesnt look good."
1,2023-02-19,People acting like kids putting others…,people acting like kids putting others in danger pushing and fighting right next to people who lift weights. there is no etiquette. people dont put plates away. its an absolute mess. plates all over the floor. when the machine is in use people just grab plates from someone elses machine. there is no management. its just a joke the entire place. never seen anything worse than this gym. no common sense no culture.

4,2023-02-19,Good Value No Nonsense Gym,"the facility is very easy to use from first set up online and very affordable. i have an off-peak membership and planned my workouts around that. the puregym online service is good and allows (to some extent) tracking of your progress. as a private person, i like puregym in that you can just use your code to get in and out and youre left alone. its quite busy most of the time so early trips tend to be better. the equipment is everything you would expect to work out, machines, freeweight, functional area, and core (meaning yoga mats and gymballs). beware. because of the price, whilst the equipment is perfectly amble, there are no frills here. no spa area or swimming pool or other mod cons. if you know the equipment this is a great budget option to get the job done. there are also classes you can book online.  overall, well worth what im paying."

1,2023-02-19,Disappointing service 😑,"i have been a puregym member since 2015 and always enjoyed my sessions at my local gym and never had any issues until recently when i just wanted to request changing my home gym and wanted to speak to somebody. i called the number which directed me to their email address. i then sent an email in which case i was given a standard automated response, so i emailed back to request a human response. 2 weeks on no one emailed me, i visited my home gym to speak to a manager but each time i went there was a notice saying that there was no manager onsite? i finally sent a message on facebook messenger to my home gym with my number requesting a callback from a manager or customer services and again 5 days on i have heard nothing!! i have been a paying member for 8 years and never stopped my direct debits although since covid i have been absent from the gym for 3years i still kept my membership going. all i wanted to do was change my home gym since there is another gym closer to me and i cannot access it until i speak to someone. in my opinion this is bad customer service and since i have worked in retail myself for 23 years i am shocked that this still happens in the digital world we live in. if this isnt resolved by the end of this month then im afraid i will be forced to cancel my membership with puregym and join the gym group or jd gyms which are also local to me now. i hope i dont have to do this and puregym can get in touch and keep me as their customer."

1,2023-02-19,The heating is on in the gym and it’s not very welcoming for women,"the heating is on in the gym, particularly near the treadmill when air con or even nothing would be better.  the machines are very basic and set up for men - many don’t have adjustable back support or height so just too big for women.  the big weights area is very macho and takes up half the gym. women tend to go in the much smaller back room to workout.  overall this doesn’t feel like an inclusive gym when women have been part of the decision making on the design, layout and equipment."
5,2023-02-19,Good Gym!,"i like the fact men don’t stare at you. i’ve noticed people just get on with what they’re doing, no matter if you’re fat or thin! respect"

4,2023-02-19,Great trainers good classes and total…,great trainers good classes and total value for money!
3,2023-02-19,Spacious but busy,"gym is spacious and has lots of equipment, but has only one water fountain which at busy times can be inconvenient. showers are way too hot. no one wants to jump into a burning hot shower after a workout. but even still, water that hot isn’t good for the skin and i come out blotchy afterwards. staff seem friendly and i have no real problem with the gym itself, the only issue is that this gym is always busy, unless it’s 6am on weekends. due to canterbury having two universities students are there morning, noon and night. i don’t have a problem with students, but it just means that you have to abort some of your routine because too many people want to use the same machines. i can’t blame the gym for being busy, it’s great for them. overall i think the gym is value for money, just turn the shower temperature down!"
5,2023-02-19,Fantastic gym. Just a couple of things I would like to change…,"i’m so happy with the gym and how it is run. sevenoaks needed this so thank you! i would really like to see a legs, bums and tums class in the evening after 7pm as not everyone finishes work at 5pm and can make it earlier. i think it’s important to make all of the popular classes available to everyone. also, regarding the booking system, whilst i understand wanting to discourage no-shows, generally people are conscientious and won’t book unless they fully intend to make a class, but often life throws curve balls at the last minute; having to work late/stuck in traffic…all sorts, so receiving ‘a strike’ for cancelling a booking less than 4 hours before the start time (considering the fact that there are always people on waiting list for classes, who would be grateful to grab a place at the last minute) it feels unfair to punish customers who are forced to give up their place due to situations beyond their control. i think 4 hours should be reduced to 1, or 2 at most. i hope these comments are taken on board by pure gym as it would definitely enhance my experience and i’m sure that of others’ too!"

1,2023-02-16,More interested hoping than doing,the sink in the men’s changing room was out of order for over 2 months due to a small fault. on top of toilets/changing poorly maintained and staff just fake the cleaning report. member services didn’t seem that bothered so frustrated by the local gym’s running and by the corporate management.

3,2023-02-19,Gym is left in a mess every morning…,gym is left in a mess every morning that i come (4x week)  equipment is left unfixed for a number of days and sometimes weeks. men’s toilets and changing are not kept well. women’s hand dryer has been broken for some time. air conditioning is shocking and doesn’t seem to ever be on. staff don’t often look enthusiastic to be there. i understand the cost of the gym memberships are low in comparison to others however as a regular user it would be nice to have the little things sorted. more cross trainers instead of some of the step machines next to them downstairs would be good.

4,2023-02-19,The pure gym in Sevenoaks is good,"the pure gym in sevenoaks is good, lots of equipment to use. only the music in changing rooms could be quieter and dont understand why the air con was bowling hot air. that wad making the exercising very hard."
4,2023-02-19,Nice clean friendly gym,"joined following a three day free trial in december 2022. i had previously attended classes at another gym but wanted to return to gym activities but at one with better facilities.  this gym is friendly providing a wide range of equipment, weights and free space area. this allows me to plan my activities, three time a week, and perform them without any hanging around waiting for items to become free.  gym is clean, provides lockers and has plenty of cleaning stations."
3,2023-02-19,A generally good gym but the three…,a generally good gym but the three strikes for missing classes is harsh. on two occasions ive cancelled the class to allow anyone who lives closer to have the space but not within the 4 hour window. both occasions i was on my way to the gym but due to road traffic accidents my journey has been severely impeded meaning i wouldnt make it there on time. the 4 hour window doesnt account for unforeseen issues you might be faced with on the way to the class! im now blocked from booking anything for 8 days and its only the classes i do as i have no idea how to use any of the other equipment effectively.

4,2023-02-19,Clean facilities with plenty of…,clean facilities with plenty of equipments but too busy during early evenings. this means there is a wait time for using key equipment. not sure puregymncan do much about it as they have been a victim of their popular offerings. 2 hour free parking is also fantastic as it saves the hassle of additional parking charges.
5,2023-02-19,Really great gym,"really great gym, lovely atmosphere, all the equipment you can need. no complaints at all. i tried a few other gyms in the wee, but the equipment and space at puregym is superior."

4,2023-02-19,Good gym especially at discount price,good gym especially at discount price. &13 a month. one part of gym around corner is very cold. equipment type is good but there could use a few more as there are large wasted areas with nothing in. overall just as good as any other gyms but at a good price.

4,2023-02-19,Nice to see lots of youngsters using…,nice to see lots of youngsters using the gym but sometimes it gets too busy and they seem to be socialising rather than exercising. i can’t seem to get onto the wi-fi to use the app whilst in the gym either
3,2023-02-19,I have nothing bad to say about staff…BUT,i have nothing bad to say about staff etc they all seem lovely.  what i don’t rate is the layout of the gym kind of expected more from puregym compared to the ones i’ve seen in the past. there needs to be more cable attachments such as straight curling bars and ropes there aren’t enough. the space could have been used better i understand you do classes but there are essentially 2 large rooms not really being optimised for more machines or weight based areas.  just my opinion but i know for a fact other people will agree with what i’m trying to say. might be worth considering a layout change in the future but for now it’s okay.
3,2023-02-19,Clean and tidy gym,"clean and tidy gym, staff seem friendly enough. only problems i have is it’s too small, the equipment is too close together. it seems to always be full and i would rather pay abit extra to have a sauna, steam room and swimming pool."
4,2023-02-19,Gym membership,"having taught fitness classes, worked in and managed a gym for over 23 years, i have never needed a gym membership, but i have thoroughly loved being a member at ashford. staff are friendly, kit is clean and rarely out of use and members are friendly and courteous. great job!"

1,2023-02-19,Couple things really,"couple things really but mainly human ignorance and lack taking something serious till it’s to late, lucky i don’t take things to seriously but if someone says there’s a problem with a machine or two have a look, and if that someone tells 3 members of staff, surely it’s good enough right, we’ll it’s a no, and it took me hurting myself on the cycle machine to get pissed off and go to the main manager and even then i had to be quite hostile for him to take it seriously, 👍🏻 good work pure-gym team,"

4,2023-02-19,pure Gym Livingston,gym is kept in a clean and tidy manner.  staff are always helpful and welcoming.  equipment although a bit older is kept in good serviceable condition.  marked down slightly at not all of the cleaning stations are kept topped up with fluid but a small point in the great scheme of things.
5,2023-02-15,Great gym,"its a really well laid out and well equipped gym. i have visited a couple of other sites whilst travelling, and some of them feel much more crowded than the wisbech branch. staff always say hi first thing in the morning and are always approachable."
4,2023-02-19,I love pure gym,"i love pure gym. it’s in walking distance to me, it’s peaceful and pleasant but why i gave it 4 stars and i was thinking shall i change it to free is cause since i’ve been a member, i’ve only been able to use the free weights about 5 times. that’s a joke to me"
4,2023-02-17,Has everything you need,has everything you need. wish that the sanitizing wipes were provided to clean so that equipment could be wiped down after use.

3,2023-02-19,Some classes have too many people for…,"some classes have too many people for the space so feels cramped. instructors when eg doing circuits or sweat45 don’t show you how to do the exercises of the different stations or the correct technique, also if someone is doing the wrong technique the instructors don’t correct them so disappointing in that respect. also so far the flavoured water i’ve tried have not been that nice ☹️"
4,2023-02-19,Very nice gym,"very easy to get used to the equipment, other gym members are friendly and there is help on hand for anything you are facing."
5,2023-02-19,Stockport North,enjoy visiting stockport north gym.  would recommend this gym if you are worried about going to a gym for the first time.
3,2023-02-19,Decent Value for Money,"theres a nice diversity of equipment, but the gym could use larger, stitched medicine balls and boxes of different heights for box jumps. the weight room is a little short on the lighter weights (12s, 14s, 16s). it would be great if small towels were available and the gym smelled a bit fresher."
3,2023-02-19,Good gym but none of the machines work…,good gym but none of the machines work properly for drinks and snacks and the multi vitamin water hasn’t worked for weeks

4,2023-02-19,Great value gym,"gym is clean, well set up and has plenty of staff to ask for help if needed! good variety of weights and machines."
4,2023-02-19,Good value for money,"i enjoy going to puregym, the machines are all well maintained and it has everything i need. only slight down side would be that some of the machines are quite close together, so at busy periods it can feel like youre exercising with a complete stranger right next to you. i appreciate that city centre space is at a premium, but id like it if some of the machines could be spread out a little more.  apart from this minor gripe, the place is well run, clean, and has plenty of lockers and cleaning areas for paper towels and disinfectant to clean your machine. for the price, its very good value for money. if you dont need things like saunas, swimming pools etc then puregym is a very good bet - it does the fundamentals very well."
3,2023-02-19,Don't like that I can not get booked on…,"dont like that i can not get booked on classes i work full time and can only come after work and they are always full, not enough classes on a weekend as well."

4,2023-02-19,The only criticism I have is the need…,the only criticism i have is the need for an additional 1kg through to 9kg weight tree in the free weight area since they are the most frequently used among gym goers
4,2023-02-19,I love the fact that this is 24h gym,i love the fact that this is 24h gym! however most of the time is really busy. but as im doing my training around 4am this is not an issue for me.

3,2023-02-19,Gym is decent,"gym is decent, the bottom floor isn’t big enough for people like me who goes to the gym at busy hours due to my schedule. i’m always stuck upstairs having to stick to machines because there’s never really any free equipment downstairs for me to use. pure gym hammersmith is a good gym but a little on the small side otherwise i do like the gym 👍"

1,2023-02-19,The drain in all of the men toilet have…,the drain in all of the men toilet have been blocked for the past three weeks i have been attending the catford branch. this makes showering totally unpleasant and disgusting with stuff coming up from the drain and water overflowed. it’s a shame that this doesn’t seems like an issue for the management and you are thinking to use this branch and also have a shower after workout maybe you should consider an alternative gym.

5,2023-02-18,Eli!,"pure gym calcot is a fantastic gym. but what makes this gym 5 star is classes delivered by the incredible pt eli. her passion,   expertise and professionalism are delivered each and every time. after a class you feel as you really have pushed yourself to be your best. you leave the gym feeling on top of the world. eli is a complete credit to her profession and calcot puregym are very lucky to have her."

3,2023-02-15,Shouldn't have changed the machines,"gym quality fell after some machines were exchanged at the start of the year. for example, swapping 3 hammer strength machines for 2 cable machines. this gym has become like every other commercial gym consisting of mostly weight stack machines. other than that, the gym is clean and tidy most of the time."
2,2023-02-15,Had a few issues with the internet…,"had a few issues with the internet which caused it to close during out of manned hours times about 5/6 times. for people who mainly train in them hours it’s been very frustrating. also the heaviest dumbbells are 40kg, it would be good if there was heavier ones. all the equipment is new and nice to use and when it’s not closed in the unmanned hours it’s a great gym."

5,2023-02-12,Definitely recommend!,"the staff are friendly, the facilities are clean, and the cardio machines (the only part of the gym i use) are in good working order."
4,2023-02-15,The facility is clean,"the facility is clean, equipment good and a comprehensive range. it would be great if you would offer pump classes during the day, either mid-late morning or lunchtime. a really annoying item is one of you male spin instructors who continuously says ‘come on, bob on’???????? it doesn’t come across well as a professional instructor! thank you."
5,2023-02-19,NERINGA GREBLIAUSKIENE,"neringa grebliauskiene i’m absolutely loving the classes by neringa. has been fantastic in all the classes.her training style is exceptional, and the overall vibe is great and i have had nothing but good experiences. i definitely recommend neringa to my friends and family. incredible workouts for the best results."
5,2023-02-16,Really enjoying my time at pure gym,"im really enjoying my time at pure gym, im a lady in her 60s but dont feel discriminated or awkward amongst others a lot fitter and younger, everyone just gets on to do their own thing.  the staff are lovely and very helpful. two things which aren t so good is that the classes get booked so quick and being my age there are only two that i can do and often find im on a waiting list due to the members with a fornightly booking system.  also there is never enough antibacterial  lotion or blue paper so the equipment and mats are not clean down as often as they should be by users.  but really enjoying getting fit and losing a bit of weight at my own pace with help at hand when i need it.  staff are lovely."
5,2023-02-15,Its OK,its ok. as clean as you can get for a busy gym. staff are friendly and helpful
5,2023-02-18,Refreshing hot shower,"great equipment, spotlessly clean, lovely warm shower and friendly staff"
4,2023-02-19,Overall I love this gym,"overall i love this gym (nuneaton) friendly staff and great classes, however the toilets really need some tlc, there are only 3 and they are unisex - none in the changing rooms so often none available due the number of people in the gym. also, the lockers really need an upgrade too: lots of dodgy locking systems that don’t work so it’s sometimes a worry that i’ll lock my stuff in and not be able to unlock the door. would be great if they could have new lockers!"
2,2023-02-18,People looking to start the gym… don’t bother with PureGym,"the price of the gym is way too expensive. puregym doesn’t offer anything more than it’s competitors for the price either. the atmosphere of a puregym in comparison to other gyms is not friendly or welcoming, more like an exclusive boys club. if you are inexperienced in the gym, bigger in size or a woman you will receive stares the whole time you are there. i am by no means a newbie to exercise and was made to feel extremely uncomfortable the entire time i was there whilst learning the new machines."
3,2023-02-15,I left my towel on one of the…,"i left my towel on one of the equipments and the day after was gone. it is most likely that was stolen, however, i am still waiting to have a responses from the staff to know if they have gone through the cameras to check what happened and i haven’t had any news yet. it is already passed two weeks. overall the gym is well-equipped and roomy. the only bad thing is the smell that there inside the amenities which is terrible. they should consider to make the air cleaner by using ozone system to sanitise and recycle the environment."

2,2023-02-18,I felt discriminated against,"i felt discriminated against, the coaches dont know what they do there? if they are never there for something, they leave their business card, i suppose for some advice, or something? but you ask them and they even yell, and they get angry. i really only go to that gym because it is very close to me but i feel extremely uncomfortable and even more seeing the person who discriminated against me and even a hundred who was also racist"

4,2023-02-17,It's okay,the weights being reracked poorly does worsen the experience and itd be good if more staff were proactive in tidying the gym to make up for the users missplacing thing. but the equipmemt is good and the experience is good for the price even if its not perfect or the most clean and tidy. the staff ive interacted have been kind. i wouldnt expect much better for the price.

5,2023-02-18,Fun morning classes,the early morning classes mean that i get to the gym before work and other things get in the way and i am not tempted to delay or postpone sessions.  the instructors give clear instructions and are enthusiastic (good motivators).  the people attending are a range of fitness levels (not muscle bound gym monsters) and i don’t feel out of place.
4,2023-02-15,Reasonable price,"reasonable price, clean, lots of equipment which is always functional. never broken. classes for those who want them.  does get too busy though at peak times."
4,2023-02-15,Great gym,great gym - 2 things that would make it better: toilets where cleaned more regularly (things also always broken e.g lock on cubicle door)  there’s limited matt space and guys just leave benches and barbells and heavy weights in the middle all the time so just blocks the space completely - i often struggle to move some of these heavy items out the way - staff need to move them back more regularly or encourage lads to tidy the equipment away as quite often there’s limited space for me in these areas
5,2023-02-18,Always clean and plenty of equipment,"always clean and plenty of equipment, love the 24hr opening too as it enables me to go whenever i like, fitting around my work schedule"

5,2023-02-18,Good value for money,"good value for money, good variety of equipment and more designated areas for free weights and your own exercises compared with other similarly priced competitors. regular classes you can book on to and the additional option of paying in-house pts if you want some focused training. i cant speak for other gyms of theirs in other areas but its nice that there is a mixture of inexperienced and lifelong gym goers. thankfully not many meatheads on steroids unlike some places! the only things i think it could improve on is to have some extra equipment so there are a couple of the same thing weights wise. i.e. bench press, triceps extension/arm curl station, leg curl station also the dip/chin up bar (by the vending machines) i also couldnt see a way to buy padlocks to fit the lockers. some gyms have vending machines for these but all i could see was protein bars and drinks."

3,2023-02-15,Nice gym but there is a lack of…,"nice gym but there is a lack of equipment for a proper training session. furthermore, the gym is continuously busy up until at least 2300hrs in order to to do a decent session, without the equipment being used. however, this is likely due to it being february and a larger number of people using the gym. i understand it’s a public gym and one of the better ones to use as a civilian, but it’s a lot more busy than most of the alternatives, and it’s cramped compared to what i was used too. i’d recommend it for a beginner; but not for someone who wants to do a good session or a heavy workout. i would advise to have more equipment and a specific time zone for those that are there wanting to use the gym for a proper workout without lots of people in there, but at a time when it’s not 2300 at night. i would come back if it was quieter, had more equipment and wasn’t as busy. the 24/7 timings were a big bonus compared to other gyms, which is something you don’t see."

4,2023-02-16,Value for money on a budget,"value for money on the lower budget end of gym membership. i use the equipment mainly, rather than attend classes. treadmills could be updated, but again, has what i need for a good workout"
5,2023-02-18,Well equipped and laid out gym!,"the gym is well laid out, well equipped and a nice environment to train, the easy 24 hour access make attending easier especially working shifts although late night is my preferred due to the daytime being very busy."
3,2023-02-18,Could be better.,likes. 24 hour access. good range of kit dislikes. dirty toilets and changing rooms. no hand sanitizer. paper towels to clean machines had run out. overall i enjoy pure gym as it is good value and accessable 24 hours. i find it difficult sometimes to get on kit due to the number of users though. also it can be very unhygienic especially the toilets and changing rooms. so could be better.

4,2023-02-18,It was 5 star rate at the start,"it was 5 star rate at the start. but the gym is getting over crowded anytime. add more equipments at the basement. virtual studio doesn’t need big space, how many people use this based on per day, compared to the area of resistance training equipments. studio is a dead spot."

3,2023-02-18,Gym equipment is great,"gym equipment is great. downside is changing facilities, showers after dirty with showers having a damp mouldy smell to them. toilets rarely have loo roll in them early mornings.  some members who go there late nights leave the weights and dumbells all over the floors bars never put back its health and safety issue particularly on a, sunday morning. the gym has cameras why cant staff look who is leaving it in this, state and ban, warn them."

1,2023-02-01,NO LONGER 24/7,"i was using the gym mainly at night, and recently they changed the hours so that its like going back to 1990 hours. for an unmanned gym its ridiculous. living in hove, it made no sense to continue regretfully as i prefer puregym to the gym group. but who wants to pay the same for less?"
2,2023-02-18,No further comments,"compared to the local council leisure centre, the puregym machines are outdated. vending machines are a big scam. paid way to much for water that never came out of it. the staff available is nice and friendly but not able to help."
5,2023-02-18,Great gym and price for the gym…,great gym and price for the gym memberships. i go to the west thurrock gym and its the best with music and full on every day. love the gym and highly recommend for anyone to join and use the gym. it has everything that a gym needs and huge space with two floors.
5,2023-02-18,Decent gym,"it is clean and tidy, plenty of equipment, gym staff/trainers present, havent encountered any crazy tiktokers so far :)"
3,2023-02-17,Not difficult to earn more stars with a bit of effort,"some of the instructors are really nice and their classes are motivating. sadly, others not quite so and they give the impression they would rather be somewhere else than in the studio. changing/toilet areas are not always as clean as they could be, depending on the time of day. this is clearly related to when the cleaner has been so perhaps they need to clean more often? recently, there were 145 people using the gym and that is obviously going to create lack of equipment and more mess. i would have given more stars had the above been one-offs but they are not."

3,2023-02-18,Enforcement and security. Standards please.,"depends on what time you are about to go. if your planning during peak hours avoid. reason?  smelly - (and not over sweaty people only), but smell of alcohol, weed that is unbearable to sustain and it should not be allowed such manners of condition to train overall.  messy - all the weights are all over the place (due of course clients fault) , but i reckon that should be at least 1 staff/cleaner that should at least give a quick sweep or clean/order as a routine during operation hours.  staff is alright, although they all chase the extra client or to busy with their schedules to answer basic question about the machines.  nothing crazy about the gym structure. it does the job."

4,2023-02-18,More classes at the weekend please… work days can be tricky,"the classes i have been to are great at bromsgrove.  tim is an excellent instructor and really gave me and my friend a good walk around the gym before we joined.  i am a bit limited on when i can attend as i have other classes on tuesdays and thursdays (ballet and badminton) and as some of the classes i like are either to difficult to get to after work or sporadic such as combat, i don’t really feel i’m making the most of my membership especially as i have to work longer hours unexpectedly and i have a dog at home which needs to see me at some point. ideally more options on the weekend would help such as pilates or yoga so there is less rushing around. i try to attend body tone on saturday mornings when i can, that class is fab!!  apart from that the gym itself is a really good facility it’s a relaxed non intimidating environment which i must try and use and slot it in with other commitments.  thanks for coming to bromsgrove but more weekend classes please…yoga on a sunday perhaps😀"
5,2023-02-18,Excellent value for money,"excellent value for money - every piece of equipment is there multiple times, it’s clean, and open 24/7. what else do you need from a gym?"

5,2023-02-18,Bicycle Parking,being going since beginning of year and am enjoying it; only thing i’d like to see by way of improvement is somewhere secure to leave my bike whilst in the gym; don’t like leaving it outside tesco store.
5,2023-02-18,I have been going to this gym since the…,i have been going to this gym since the new year . i was previously at another gym but there never seemed to have any pts to ask for help. from my induction the manager nick listened to my goals and took me around the gym and showed me how to use the equipment  and i have so much more confidence now . everyone is friendly and the gym is spotless.

3,2023-02-18,Lots of places for improvement,"honestly lots of cardio equipment, 3 squat racks, 2 bench presses, 2 smith machines, 2 cable machines and some muscle isolation machines. honestly if you want more than cardio you waste your money as there are plenty of other places better equipment than this gym. also it took them 1 week to fix an issue that cause a bad smell in the locker room. :("
4,2023-02-18,Good session,"good session. rather than skip. i went in with only a short time to do any thing. got changed and got a locker no problem. down to the gym floor, found a rowing machine, did a games session. then a few sets with free weights, shower, out. no hassle"

3,2023-02-18,Too many kids,"too many kids - don’t put any weights away and hang around in groups which means the equipment is tied up for a long time. never seen the staff speak to anyone about putting their weights away either, doesn’t feel like they notice and do anything about it. annoying"

5,2023-02-18,Feeling Welcome,"for first time one of the staff positively came over & said hello rather than what is the norm of standing around at the entrance. he was new & it made a difference- for first time since i joined i felt welcomed rather a cursory nod. as it appears edinburgh craigleith is not on the drop down menu - i provide this intel,"
2,2023-02-18,Tiny and overpriced,"specifically eccles, it is cramped, with never enough equipment available, miniscule changing facilities, and quite frankly shocking that it is in a higher price bracket than gyms with much more space and accommodation available."

1,2023-02-17,Shortening of opening time and underage users,reducing the opening times has had a knock on affect to my training. this was not emailed out to the members.  as well a number of underage children using the facilities. adding to the overcrowding of the gym in peak hours please sort both out or i will be moving on to another

4,2023-02-18,"Overall no complaints, just a few suggestions","the gym is clean, tidy and well presented, and there is a large amount of equipment, set out well! the only downside is that people walking by within the shopping centre can look straight in, which might be fine for some people however for those starting out at the gym, they don’t need people’s peering eyes in them. there is a variety of classes which is great however it is difficult to book on due to availability, so more frequent classes would be helpful, otherwise the classes i have been able to attend have been really good, the only improvement required would be the frequent inability to hear the instructor during the class, poor quality microphone?  overall no complaints regarding the gym, just a few suggestions/improvements to consider."

2,2023-02-18,"Low price, low standards","it’s clear that they don’t really care about their customers. as a company, not talking about the staff. they just want a lot of members, knowing that 1/4 of them actually use the gym. lockers are a joke, it’s like we are in 1980s, all the weights and equipment are scattered around the gym, there is no air ventilation and windows so you can imagine how it smells, they even allow 15 year old to “work out” here, more like take space and be annoying to everyone. the reason i go there is only because i live near and it’s spacious. at the end of the day they have thousands of members because of the low price and that’s the only thing this company cares about."

4,2023-02-18,Overall it’s great,"overall it’s great, amazing equipment and great use of the space. one thing i would change would be the ability to clean machines yourself. i don’t often see staff in the building and at my previous gym they had cleaning stations so you could clean things before or after your session. i just feel it’s lacking for that, and if that’s not the option then to have staff cleaning throughout would be better."

But cleanliness","training and equipment-wise, this is one of the best puregyms ive been to  but there is a persistent problem of cleanliness in the mens changing rooms. same issue day after day, and that is there is a really strong dried urine smell. this isnt new, since there are reviews going back months and years complaining about this.  something is therefore going wrong with the management of the gym here. either the place isnt being cleaned properly (in which case management need to action this and change the way cleaning is supervised). or there is a structural problem with the plumbing drainage, meaning things are leaking back into the room (in which case management need to get onto hq or regional managers to fund proper estate maintenance). its been going on just too long. im not very fussy about cleanliness (ive trained in dirty gyms in asia). but i work in healthcare and do homevisits and the smell of the mens changing room is as bad as the home of a vulnerable elderly person who has fallen into severe self-neglect. this sort of smell should not be in a busy modern uk gym, day after day, month after month"

5,2023-02-17,Excellent Classes,"i’ve only been a member here for three weeks but i’m loving it so far. the app is great. the gym is really clean. friendly and helpful staff. the best thing is the selection of classes. i love doing classes and puregym has loads of classes at lots of different times of the day so there’s something to suit everyone. the best class by far is body tone with rahul aubeeluck on friday evenings. it’s a really intense session but gives a fantastic full body workout with weights with lots of options for everyone. he works us hard but he’s so polite (i’ve never heard a fitness instructor say please so often), the music is great for the style of class too. the tempo fits really well with lifting weights. i’ve tried a bunch of other classes too and they’ve all been fab: cycle, pilates, yoga, dance, & pump. one thing that really stands out is that all the instructors take the time to make sure they include a warm up at the beginning and some time to stretch at the end of each class. this isn’t always the case at other local gym classes. the only downside is that i miss having a swimming pool at the gym but there are several great pay as you go pools nearby. i haven’t really tried any of the machines etc yet but will definitely be using the treadmills on rainy long run days. one day i might get brave enough to do some dead lifts in the weights room!"

3,2023-02-16,Good atmosphere but feels tight when it…,"good atmosphere but feels tight when it picks up and not even at peak times. cleanliness could be a lot better, lots of mess around the gym (empty bottles, spills etc) not cleaned and the equipment itself is never wiped down. changing rooms are very small and generally not clean enough. your workouts can be interrupted by classes setup outside of the studio so be aware of these"
5,2023-02-17,Really lovely gym,really lovely gym. nice staff
5,2023-02-17,Pure Gym is an excellent gym,"pure gym is an excellent gym, there are lots of classes that run all day long. the instructors bring the energy and make the classes fun for all abilities."
2,2023-02-15,It’s cold and dark,it’s cold and dark? where are the windows? no mirrors around the squat racks so can’t check my squats. no cleaning station so the kit was sweaty after using it. i did like the lockers though as they were really big and could fit everything in easily.
4,2023-02-16,good gym,"everything is very good, the gym is big almost all the time busy, the only point that i think should be improved is that the trainers should help people a little when they see that a person is doing an exercise wrong.  for the rest everything is fine."
5,2023-02-16,Excellent equipment and friendly…,excellent equipment and friendly informative staff.
1,2023-02-17,I’ve made the decision to look for…,i’ve made the decision to look for another gym now. all you get is “we’re reviewing the changes” and this review seems to be going on for a long time. i can’t be dealing with the rammed gym anymore. you’re lucky to even find a free bench in the weights section. thank you for completely turning me off puregym for the foreseeable future. i’m cancelling my membership. and save me the same “due to low usage hours…” response you give to everyone else. so many people have complained and pledged to change gyms and you don’t even give proper updates or discounts for the changes. so bye.
5,2023-02-16,Bangor gym is fantastic…,bangor gym is a fantastic for the money.  the only puregym i was not keen on was camden.
2,2023-02-16,The problem with that gym is always the…,"the problem with that gym is always the changing room, toilets and shower areas. always disgusting and the majority of lockers dont lock anymore. definitely it needs one good attention in there and if possible a few more water stations spreaded along the gym with water filters. many thanks, me."
5,2023-02-17,Carlton center Lincoln  brilliant n,lovely clean gym. wasnt sure at first when pure gym was opening nr me as had looked at another one and wasnt impressed.but please i joined i love it
1,2023-02-16,PureGym won’t let me leave,puregym has become expensive and overcrowded at my local gym in east london so i wanted to leave. puregym provide instructions on how to leave on the app but following those instructions brings you back to the instructions. in other words they won’t let you leave.

5,2023-02-16,Great Facilities,"cleanliness is very good, i often see instructors wiping down machines and hoovering. friendly fitness instructors that are all approachable.  lots of space which is nicely spread out with areas available for crossfit style workouts, areas available for stretching and a really good variety of machines and weights. really impressed with the gym overall."
5,2023-02-17,My BIG negative.,"i feel that the gym does an excellent job by providing friendly and helpful staff. as said, good equipment and easy parking if one goes early in the morning. my big, really big negative which is not the gym or staff fault is the customers using their mobile phones when sitting on equipment. not listening to music but sending text , messages and holding people up who wish to use the equipment. they should be told by staff to either move from the equipment sit on the bench provided when texting or receiving messages. this has nearly stopped me from being a member. now i have to visit early in the morning, 7.00am or before to avoid the mobile hacks, why when it could be controlled by a simple note to all members explaining the reasons. this is not just me having a hissy fit other members i have spoken with totally agree. if asked by a none member i would have to mention this if asked for a recommendation. sorry."
4,2023-02-16,Friendly gym and helpful staff,"friendly gym and helpful staff, good range of equipment, cleaning in the showers could be a bit better."
2,2023-02-17,Robbing customers,"why do puregym take money out your account when there not supposed to. once again had money taken from my account, when sign up evidence from puregym directly shows i am not due to make a payment till march, so why are they trying to rob me. this is the second time i’ve had issues with puregym and them entering my account. so frustrating that you can’t even talk to someone on the phone about the matter. i’m not impressed and will be complaining over this again"
3,2023-02-16,Cutting costs by removing TVs,"cutting costs by removing tvs, that makes the atmosphere a bit depressing. plus new colour scheme.. again depressing. gyms are generally ok. equipment could do with being cleaned a bit more. get what you pay for, cheap gym, makes me want to really push through my workout fast so i can leave faster."
5,2023-02-17,I love the gym...,the gym has all the facilities that we need to achieve our goals and specially the friendly and free environment.

3,2023-02-16,I like gym's personel,"i like gyms personel, they are all so kind and pashionate about it. the bad side of this gym is parking, 2 hours is not enough as you have to park first, come to gym, change, workout, change, and go through the ramp in two hours time frame. the bad is also being so many kids in the gym. they have no respect to equipment, leaving weights everywhere, leaving trash as cans, empty bottles everywhere, etc"
4,2023-02-16,I love it,"i love it, it has a lot of spaces to train whatever you want. has a lot of equipment and clean.  needs improvement regarding hygiene in showers area. but overall great"

4,2023-02-16,Nearly there..!,"overall it’s a great gym. can’t complain how busy it gets because it’s pretty much everywhere. i would give 5 stars if not the condition of bathrooms (not working flush, not clean etc) and missing equipment from time to time."
3,2023-02-16,Too busy.,its always busy. means unable to use most of the equipment when wanting to and needing to wait ages before hand. too crowded.
5,2023-02-16,Excellent gym,excellent gym! plenty of space and very light; an easy place to find the motivation to exercise.
3,2023-02-16,For the price I think the gym could be…,for the price i think the gym could be bigger and have more weight machines such as more squat racks and a hip thrust machine and more space for people to use free weights. there is currently only 2 squat racks in a gym in the city centre which is not ideal.
3,2023-02-16,No cleaning station,"good kit, bad hygiene… no cleaning station so always training on the previous persons sweat."
5,2023-02-16,Great Gym,"clean, helpful staff, plenty of equipment, great music, variety of classes. an all round positive experience."
2,2023-02-16,Hygiene stations are essential… and not because of covid!,"gym is great - good range of kit and never too busy, always feel welcome and great atmosphere. my only complaint is there are no hygiene/wipe down stations, not nice to either leave kit sweaty or know your using a machine after someone else has sweated all over it and not been able to give it a wipe down!  **edit** i’ve lowered my rating as i don’t get how such a big chain can get something as simple as hygiene and cleanliness so wrong… it isn’t covid measures that makes having hygiene stations essential, but general gym etiquette! i haven’t seen a cleaner wiping down kit after every use to remove the last users sweat… in fact i haven’t seen a cleaner on the premises any of the evenings i’ve been to the gym this week?"
5,2023-02-16,Today was my first visit to my local…,today was my first visit to my local gym. i was made to feel very welcome the staff were extremely helpful and polite. the gym was very well equipped and all equipment very clean. i liked the idea that the cardio equipment is energy efficient. yes on the whole a very good  afternoon had by me...looking forward to my visit tomorrow!
3,2023-02-16,Generally good but needs more equipment,there needs to be more of squat racks and bench presses. there is adequate free weights and cardio. there is a lot of wasted space that could have equipment placed in it.
3,2023-02-16,The showers are always dirty gym itself…,the showers are always dirty gym itself is clean but could do more to endure showers stay clean
3,2023-02-16,Not enough classes,there are not enough classes & can never get booked onto the classes that are available! i think there should be a blind up at the front window so people in  the gym can have some privacy whilst working out.
4,2023-02-16,Nice gym,nice gym. always clean and decently equipped although could do with a couple more squat racks. the women’s locker room is very cold though.
1,2023-02-16,Dont waste your time or money,"terrible customer service and such a hassle trying to resolve issues. paying for the premium membership so i can use massage chairs and the sports water but so far this month and last theyve both been down everyday ive gone. their weight machines even though you pay for them dont seem to work, the lockers are broken, showers are dirty and smelly and theyve just had a refit! half the machines are also out of order and the ones that most people use there arent enough of so spend your time waiting around for the things that should be usable more easily."

4,2023-02-15,Overall brilliant,"pros: clean, helpful staff, very spacious. cons: not enough equipment especially at the start of the year when theres an influx of new members."
5,2023-02-16,Half workout,"contrary to the advert, you are unable to book onto classes if you dont have the membership, which covers all pure gyms.  the gym space is very good, but it feels that all members should have the option  to book onto classes as i am only paying for gym use, which is not what is advertised.  very disappointing."
5,2023-02-16,Plenty of space and kit all in good…,plenty of space and kit all in good order 👍🏼

4,2023-02-16,24-hour gym is the best,its nice to have a gym open 24 hours.
5,2023-02-16,Like my gym,plenty of equipment and clean showers. good and safe parking close to gym. i mention that because i used to go to a gym in a converted woollen mill after work. no nearby parking. came out after 9pm and my car had gone

4,2023-02-16,floor squeegee by shower,"thought it was great the floor squeegee was left by the showers, i was able to quickly wipe the floor before and after my shower. dont know if it was purposefully left out but i personally liked being able to wipe my hair away after my shower. for such a busy gym which cant be expected have a 24hr cleaner, this may help encourage gym users to clean up after themselves a bit!"
3,2023-02-16,It’s ok,"it’s ok, could do with more equipment. find myself going later and later to get access to anything."
5,2023-02-16,Great staff,"gym was nice and quiet, so quite easy to get on the equipment i wanted to use. really clean, however members that don’t put equipment away need a slap 😂. josh (manager) was really helpful. love the new spin bikes."

5,2023-02-16,Excellent facilities and staff,always plenty of choice and availability of equipment and friendly and polite staff around if you need support.  24/7 opening is a bonus as i often work shifts and facilities are well maintained - many thanks.
1,2023-02-16,not enough classes after 5pm when most…,"not enough classes after 5pm when most people can come, gym is too hot."
2,2023-02-16,Not Safe,"i went to puregym from december 2022 to the end of january 2023. the set up is good, the machines are great, the membership is easy to manage and was handy for adding a buddy. my problem was one evening a man was staring at me, he wasnt using the machines he just followed me from machine to machine staring. i tried to notify a staff member and the gym was currently unstaffed. i told a pt who happened to be there she asked if it was that guy and i said yes and she said ill tell the manager again. dont get me wrong its a good gym just not for women who workout alone."
3,2023-02-16,Not bad,"the gym is quite big with plenty of facilities. however, there are too many people at peak times. i think it might be better if puregym could do real-time stats on the crowdedness of the current time. besides, it is kinda usually there some of the components of the facilities are missing. i have met several times about that situation. considering price, it is kinda fair price so could not expect too much."

2,2023-02-16,Hoxton Gym - it’s a lottery as to when it’s open!,"this gym has been closed for 4 days in feb and was closed for a couple of days in jan due to plumbing. it is constantly closed for a day to “fix” the problem and when it isn’t closed the changing rooms are out of service causing clients to use the outside lockers.  this wouldn’t be a problem if you had sufficient space!  however, not everybody comes to a gym in their workout clothes.  what would be helpful is if you had a clothes rack behind the small reception area and handed out tickets like a cloakroom so that people knew their stuff was relatively safe.  your employees suggested that i leave my bag and coat “near” the lockers or underneath as all of them were full!  this is a great idea, when you clearly don’t accept any responsibility for theft!!  please look at installing decent plumbing and not just using a drainage company to clear the backlog every other week.  it seems that it takes forever and a day for you to sort out any problems, it took about 6 months just to get wifi set up, and the current “solution” is pretty shambolic."
4,2023-02-14,Welcome fitness,"it’s a large, spacious gym with new equipment, albeit some are already not working. (new gym) it’s very busy 5-7pm and you often have to wait for popular equipment and the parking is a nightmare then too. if you go outside of these times it’s fine. classes are varied and frequent and the instructors are friendly. only gripe is the aircon. it’s not cool enough. keep mentioning it and no change"

1,2023-02-13,Damaged my property without warning,"went to gym on 13/2, called into work and left my gym bag in the locker as i intended to come back. unfortunately i had to stay at work due to an emergency so didn’t get back to the gym until today. after my work out i went back to change and found that tom the manager had cut my padlock off and packed my stuff into a plastic bag. i was told that the lockers can’t be used for storage and after explaining to tom what happened and it wasn’t intentional, he really didn’t care, was completely unsympathetic and was not prepared to give me the benefit of doubt and just kept quoting the rules. i’ve been going to your gyms for years and have never seen any signs in any of the changing rooms informing members that their padlocks would be cut and their personal belongs removed if their stuff was left in the locker overnight. anywhere else would display notices and post a warning on the locker informing members what they would do. this is wilful damage to my property and will cost me money to replace, how can this be fair????"

3,2023-02-16,"More Equipment, Ample Space",i am glad there are more equipments to use in the gym i use. and there is ample amount of space. these are definitely a plus.  the reason i am giving only 2 stars is because it seems to be taking an awfully long time to fix broken equipment. a very popular butterfly equipment has been broken for about 2 months since i started attending regularly. i will think they should be a guy going around your gyms and fixing these things
4,2023-02-13,Good experience and opening times,"good experience and opening times, just would prefer not to have the noise of classes when i’m working out"
2,2023-02-16,The gym is an absolute mess,"the gym is an absolute mess! filthy gym , the machines look like they never get wiped down as every time i use a machine they are full of dust and grime. the floor around the machines looks like it never gets a hoover let alone a mop. my treadmill and step mill is always full of rubbish  full of  old paper towel and wrappers. one of the treadmills (the one on the left )stops working if you put the speed up high. the dumbbell area is very dirty, underneath each dumbbell is full of bits and dirt! ive seen other gyms use a steam cleaner on the dumbbell area or maybe just a wipe down would be ok. not enough machines for the volume of members. having one seated leg extension and one hamstring curl isnt good enough. the gym needs more cables as they are very busy and there isnt enough to go round. likewise having just one pec dec machine is ridiculous considering how busy the gym gets , need at least 2_3 of them. since i joined ive noticed a very bad smell near the handwash sink in the mens toilet, this smell is always there not sure if its a blockage or something. i only use this gym as its 2 mins from my daughters school and is handy after school run otherwise i wouldnt train there. before pure gym i trained at the gym group on kingsbury road and they are head and shoulders above pure gym in terms of cleanliness."

4,2023-02-16,Quite good but some downsides,"its a nice airy gym. you can decide if you want to go based on how busy it is according to the app. good price per month. lots of machines to choose from. the only downside is it can be quite warm inside, sometimes you do have to wait a long time for certain machines, and there are no kettlebell classes. we also have to pay for zumba which isnt ideal as if i didnt have to pay i would be there once a week doing zumba. it would also be nice if the yanga water was included in the core membership even if it was just £2 extra a month and not nearly £8 extra. theres not always a manager nearby either if you need help."

2,2023-02-16,Plumbing problems,there is not a lot of weight int this gym for when it is busy especially seeing it is early in the year and is busier than normal. the gym is also regularly shut because of its plumbing backing up i pay for a 24hour gym but don’t have access to that gym at least once a week but becoming more regular now so now more like 2/3 times a week. they give me access to other gyms for that time but i chose this gym for a reason that being it’s the closest to me and is convenient. and because everyone at hoxton has been given access to those two gyms they are then extremely busy this is not what i’m paying for.
4,2023-02-15,I've been a member of PureGym on and…,"ive been a member of puregym on and off since 2016, overall cant fault them at all gyms are adequately equipped and kept clean and tidy. staff are always friendly and happy to help.  only reason i cant give 5* is the discrepancy in facilities from gym to gym. for instance the urban exchange (manchester) gym is fantastic and its changing facilities really up to a good standard. market street by comparison is incredibly dated, the lockers are almost all broken or locked (can we not get the locks cut off on the lockers that are never available this must be a security issue allowing people to leave whatever they see fit in the gym day in day out), the showers are equally dated and only stay on for 5-6 seconds a time, lack of decent mirrors in the changing room for progress pics compared to other gyms (it has a huge empty wall between the first and second changing area would benefit greatly from a 2m x 1m mirror panel."

2,2023-02-16,Poor experience,"firstly, whenever someone posts an issue why do you insist members speak to the gym manager. this defeats the point of providing feedback. why do the club managers review the feedback posted and respond like they could before you moved feedback to trustpilot. my feedback consists of 3 points;  1. personal trainers not wearing uniform. had the policy changed, i thought they had to be in puregym uniform when training clients. i have recently observed several pts wearing their own clothing when training their clients. i think they should be in uniform especially if you still have a policy of non puregym pt staff not allowed to train clients in the gym.  2. pts not returning equipment. i have flagged this over the years. they should lead by example. i recently saw a pt get a step from the studio and use on the main floor with client and failed to return at the end. this is very frustrating.  3. more often than not the cleaning stations are overflowing, this morning at 7pm the bins were overflowing, only 1 dispenser had paper towels and only 1 spray had the cleaning solution. this is unacceptable. they should be cleaned and refilled at the end of the day."

1,2023-02-15,A shocking decline.,"what has happened to this once great company? where to start. reduced operating hours, deteriorating equipment, filthy changing rooms, poor customer service and substantial fees now charged for missed/late payment. all while charging 80% more now than 10 years ago. i once recommended this company to all my friends as being incredible in all the departments i now criticised above. it seems that puregym is now being run on the basis of a financial spreadsheet and the care they once had for their members is now a distant memory. really sad to see this and it’s why i cancelled my membership. as in so many aspects of life customers are being asked to pay much more for much less. didn’t think this once great company would go the same way. the future is looking bleak for puregym unless they get back to where they were pre covid."
1,2023-02-15,Feedback should be LISTENED and…,"feedback should be listened and actioned - this does not happen. for example the following should be remediated.  1- guest wifi. simply removing this from the website is not good enough when this was initially listed. wifi already exist at stratford (for staff). all the simply needs to be done is for a requested to be raised by it to add a new ssid. why is this crucial? because you get zero/poor signal which makes it impossible to load the puregym app /workout or sometimes even the barcode. not to mention ability to stream music…  2- not enough lockers! there is never enough lockers, they are always full. a simple fix, put an additional locker request order through as there is plenty of space to put this. it’s a real pain and you simply have to leave your belongings unsafe.  3- water dispenser another water dispenser should be added - why is there just one water dispenser for the whole gym of potentially 150+ members. another water dispenser is really required - you can spend 10 minutes queuing during peak times.  4- water dispenser pressure for some unbeknown reason the pipe for the water dispenser is 2mm! this means that water literally drip out resulting in an already bad problem (with one dispenser) getting worse! the plastic pipe simply needs to be increase to a standard 20/30mm pipe - this should have been picked up ages ago.  5- additional machine/weights there is plenty of space but not enough machines. for example back/lateral machine can have a constant queue during peak making it impossible to get on. another set of machine would fix this problem. there is plenty of space around the gym. free weight get taken to other areas (mats etc) which can be fixed by putting another set of weights in these areas. otherwise there simply isn’t enough weights especially the popular or weights of 6-14kg). there should be another rack of this.  6- toilets absolutely filthy especially during peak times. i’ve spent 2 hours in the gym and these were not cleaned once during this time. there should be a cleaning schedule/rota on the door so we know when these are being cleaned and that it’s being adhered to.  7- secure cycle area. this can either be done near the front entrance or by pure gym simply raising a request via newham councils website (free).  8- communication notice board a notice board with updates from the gym should be put up so its members know what issues are raised and timescales for resolution. this will help with the overall experience.  there is plenty of positives including and otherwise clean gym, staff regularly putting an abandoned weight equipment back but more still should be done to make it better."

5,2023-02-14,I'm  happy and comfortable in doing my…,im  happy and comfortable in doing my workout at the gym. they help to gain our goals and i feels more confident.
5,2023-02-14,10/10 as a woman wouldn’t want to go anywhere else,"staff are so friendly and helpful, sanitary levels are very satisfactory and the environment is a positive atmosphere. 10/10 equipment."
5,2023-02-14,The gym is welcoming,"the gym is welcoming, the staff are friendly, informative and helpful. the classes are excellent, achieving an excellent workout, with support and encouragement."
5,2023-02-14,Great gym,"the gym is clean, spacious and well laid out. it has plenty of equipment to cater for large numbers. it also has plenty of varied exercise classes and the personal trainers are a friendly bunch."
4,2023-02-14,Great d range of equipment and good…,great d range of equipment and good classes
2,2023-02-10,Too many groups. Not enough equipment,"this is not my home pure gym but i use this recently approx twice a month as regular visitor to sheffield. there is not enough equipment to cater for the amount of customers it allows in. there are too many groups of u18s using this gym and hogging the equipment meaning others cannot use it until 3-4 people have completed multiple sets. rethink capacity levels and behaviours for this gym otherwise you will lose customers. the standard of equipment is poor, most cardio machines are very old and the upstairs weights machines have variable resistance (i’m a regular gym goer and know what my level is). it’s almost as if the floor space in this gym needs to be completely rethought to best use the space. we all know that weight training is becoming increasingly popular and this gym needs to acknowledge this in provision of space and equipment. i have recently used sheffield city centre which has similar floor space but has much more modern equipment and more weights/cardio provision. one of the benefits of pure gym membership is being able to use multiple locations but the experience is not consistent and as a brand consistency of service is important."
5,2023-02-14,Ticked the box on every level,"ticked the box on every level. friendly and helpful staff, clean facilities, equipment in good working order and a very pleasant vibe to workout to. not intimidating at all."

3,2023-02-02,PUREGYM STRATFORD,"puregym stratford likes- brand new, clean, spacious, plenty of equipment, 3 separate rooms for stretching. clean showers with amenities regular cleaning personnel  dislikes: poor internet connection, pt staff have completely refused to give members the wi-fi password. the gym group allows members to access wi-fi. add more varieties of leg machines because there is plenty of space!!! standing calf raise, seated hamstring curl machine , pendulum, hack squat machine. more varieties of cable attachments would be great!!!! sometimes the music is terrible and its blasted on quite loudly lol the pts are not as friendly or approachable. the soap dispenser in the female changing room needs to be fixed at a better angle the gym should listen to customer feedback, although i have never seen the manager."
4,2023-02-14,Very Good,"good, clean equipment. music could be improved."
5,2023-02-13,Excellent gym,a member of staff aiden made us feel at home as it was our first time at a gym. the atmosphere was extremely friendly and chilled out. i was anxious before going but that melted away pretty quickly.
5,2023-02-14,The range of equipment is great,the range of equipment is great. the classes are also very good and staff and customers are really friendly and helpful.

3,2023-02-14,The windows in the gym should be…,the windows in the gym should be frosted or covered with posters so people in the gym can get a bit of privacy.
1,2023-01-28,Worst decision ever,moving from 24-7 to limited hours has to be the worst thing they could do. completely outside my normal workout hours. i dont want to train at puregym limehouse. the price has also stayed the same since the change too.
2,2023-02-14,Deteriorating all the time,"unfortunately puregym sydenham is deteriorating all the time. it was never the most relaxed atmosphere, but now the hot water is off again only three weeks after it was fixed after the previous two week outtage, two benches out of order, lots of other stuff broken, weights crumbling in places or disappearing."
5,2023-02-14,Excellent instructor this morning. Jaime -lee did an excellent pump class,i love all the classes and the instructors are very good. ive just done jaime -lees pump class and i would recommend her to anyone wanting to get or keep fit.

5,2023-02-13,great gym great classes which i should…,great gym great classes which i should go
3,2023-02-13,Probably gonna switch back to my old gym,"equipment feels a bit cramped together and even though its a brand new facility the dim lighting and lack of natural lighting only adds to the feeling, cant fault anything else i just dont like the general vibe of the place, will probably go back over the road to gym group"
5,2023-02-14,Annie is an amazing coach,"annie is an amazing coach. she has me excited to come to the gym on tuesday and friday mornings for her classes, even though i leave sweaty and sore every time. she is fantastic at making the class feel welcoming and accessible for all abilities. thank you annie"
5,2023-02-13,Great gym,"been going to the gym regularly during the daytime since it opened. love this place, seems well equipped and staff all friendly. the different gym classes are great, lots of variety and a positive challenge."

5,2023-02-12,The opening times are excellent fits in…,the opening times are excellent fits in around my working life. equipment also good
4,2023-02-13,Decent gym at a fair price,"decent gym at a fair price within walking distance to me so a no brainer. my only complaints, mirroring those of others is that the equipment is faulty fairly regularly and the gym is certainly oversubscribed.  i understand they are a business and want to make as much money as possible, but the experience is definitely worsened by there being too many people almost all of the time. everyone i know that attends this gym has said the same thing so i hope they come up with a solution."
1,2023-02-13,they just decide to change the schedule…,"they just decide to change the schedule and nothing was announced?  will the monthly fee be reduced? london road is far from my house!  horrible place and no ventilation, carpet smells bad.  impossible to use a gym with carpet on the floor.  review times to open from 5 am and close at midnight.  and on weekends open the same hours because there are people who are off and want to have flexible hours and not limited"
5,2023-02-13,Great gym,"great gym, with welcoming and friendly staff. i live the classes and always find one i can join onto."
4,2023-02-13,No air con,plenty of equipment to choose from & always availability but the place needs air conditioning to be put on or a regular blast of fresh air going through the place. ive lost count of the amount of times if the air conditioning can be put on. shame really
1,2023-02-13,Refurb/Open times,"used to be 24 hours, used to go in til 11/12pm and was absolutely fine.  got told the hours were changing because of the refurb, then staff told us the refurb wasnt happening and the hours were due to utility costs and the refurb was cancelled - felt like it was smoke and mirrors  the gym now is limited to 10pm and is rammed on a daily.. its always at 100+ capacity due to the hours which makes using equipment difficult.  received an email today saying the refurb is now happening with the following statement ""the gym will remain open so you can still come in and work out at any time""  any time?? should probably be reworded."
1,2023-01-28,Bad experience with a member of the staff,"overall the gym is good, however, customer service is very poor. members of the staff are often hard to find and, if they happen to be around, they are usually talking with each other or with customers for a long time. i recently had a very bad experience with the manager, phoebe pearce. i wanted to ask about a missed bottle that i had left the day before at the gym and she replied being rude and disrespectful."
5,2023-02-11,What a pleasure!,"i visited hemel pure gym on saturday with my boyfriend, the gym had a lovely atmosphere, very clean changing room and gym area and the gym looked very well cared for and looked after. the temperature was perfect and i felt like there was lots of space in the gym to do all exercises i wanted to do. i will definitely be coming back!"
5,2023-02-13,Lovely gym,"lovely, friendly atmosphere. people of all ages & ability so at 65 i dont feel out of place. friendly staff & plenty of equipment."

4,2023-02-13,Great staff and gym,"great staff, especially denzel and many others, the equipment is also very good and has a great atmosphere"
3,2023-02-13,Poor opening hours,"used to love the gym due to its time flexibility and location, due to family and shifts i tend to go gym around 9pm for 2 hours however due to the change of times (of which i’ve received mixed info - permanent/temporary time change and potentially, puregym pulling out on the upgraded equipment) it’s become a lot harder to attend at my original chosen time. i’ve recent been getting there 30 mins early but with 3x more gym goers in during these times to what it once was therefore unable to use the equipment i want. overall the gym itself is good, the times could be better suited over the 7 day period to make the gym more enjoyable and less busy. if no changes, i will be reviewing my membership to change to a 24hrs/midnight close gym."
2,2023-02-13,Unhappy about change from 24/7 times,"until recently i was perfectly happy with this gym. the change from 24/7 to its new hours is what really disappoints me. its what i signed up for. 8pm closing on a saturday is such a contrast. why not make it more like 10pm at least? 10pm closing on a weeknight is too such a contrast - at least make it midnight? i echo comments about the london road gym which which weve been given access to from 9pm on weekdays - its disgusting. warm, smelly, dirty, untidy and moisture-filled. is my membership cost going to be reduced? i doubt it. my experience of lara the manager is great, it must be said."
4,2023-02-12,Nice equipment and team,"nice equipment and team, but always super busy"
5,2023-02-12,"Legs, bums and tums","great fitness class with a motivational trainer. a very clean, safe, confidence building space in which to work out and get fit. very friendly gym."

1,2023-02-12,Have used the lisburn pure gym for…,"have used the lisburn pure gym for literally years now! arrived tonight entered my code and received a red light at the console, retried same thing again. logged into app to scan qr code same thing again!  checked email and received a email: you have received this email because pin number **** etc doesnt allow access to puregym lisburn laganbank. to change that, simply visit the kiosk or visit the website to upgrade in your members area  checked my app it states home gym is belfast st annes square (havent used this gym in about 6 years) no way to change this. no members of staff at the gym to discuss this issue.  i ve had multi gym access from the start of my membership now on the app its looking a further £7 when last week i was at the same gym i cant access tonight as usual without any issues!"
4,2023-02-12,Everything you could want except…,"everything you could want except a punch/kickbag, i would love one in the gym. in my opinion it’s all that’s missing."
5,2023-02-12,Great gym,love the variety of classes and find the instructors to be helpful and professional - always plenty of parking outside i look forward to my cycle/spin classes and can really feel a difference in myself for doing these :)
4,2023-02-12,Overall not bad,reasonable with its price but the smell is horrible
3,2023-02-11,Actually a good gym and not as bad some people say,"its a good space, location and loads a equipment just bring baby wipes to clean the stations. i normally go to the pure gym in farringdon after work and was conscious to go the stratford one on the days i work from home after reading the reviews but not as bad as people make it out to be. one of the better gyms around that area"
4,2023-02-12,Stratford Gym 👍,good clean equipment and plenty of it. friendly staff on hand to help those who are new to gym life. having air con ducts over the running machine is ideal.
4,2023-02-12,Best Gym,friendly and helpful staff variety of equipments ladies only area cleanliness- changing area and showers variety of classes.
4,2023-02-11,The gym is okay but if it was really…,the gym is okay but if it was really busy it will be hard to use certain equipment
1,2023-02-12,"DO NOT use the ""free"" parking!!","do not use the ""free"" parking!!! i have only been a member since october 2022 & have received 2 parking fines.  i appealed both online as soon as i received them - didnt hear anything back on the first one until i received a letter from a debt recovery company saying i now need to pay £170!!  the second one is now with popla.  the anxiety and stress this is causing far outweighs the benefits of the gym.  as there is no receipt given when you enter your car registration you have no evidence to submit when trying to appeal!  free parking should not be advertised as a benefit for this gym."
2,2023-02-12,Stafford PureGym demise,"the gym has drastically gone down hill in recent months - coincidentally since the beginning of the new manager - dereece. firstly, the gym stinks. there is a foul odour in the changing rooms and walkways. a lot of the attachments for the cables have been missing for weeks and haven’t been replaced. the hand dryer in the men’s changing room has broken for months. general mood of people in the gym is much worse than when jess was manager. i’m strongly considering leaving gyms to go elsewhere unless things start to improve."
5,2023-02-12,The staff is professional helpful and…,the staff is professional helpful and friendly thank antonia
5,2023-02-12,Luca is an amazing PT,luca is an amazing pt. working with him has given me so much confidence in the gym and the ability to lift more weight then i thought i would ever be able to. would highly recommend to anyone looking for a pt.
5,2023-02-11,Gym is always clean,"gym is always clean. staff are friendly, machines always maintained."
1,2023-02-06,24/7 no more!,horrible decision for not being open 24/7 anymore. people are paying more expensive membership fee for this just to be referred to a gym (limehouse) with cheaper monthly rate. is this fair? no!  you guys need to move the opening time back to 24/7 asap!
5,2023-01-12,Very good gym,"i’m satisfied because the gym is ,clean, has air conditioners ,water tap and cool vending machines. and good at night"
5,2023-02-10,Great PT session with Daniel at Camden Pure Gym,"i was a bit nervous about getting into weights and needed help with technique and creating a workout.  daniel was super friendly and immediately made me feel at ease. he understood my needs and had the perfect balance of empathising with my worries, whilst also pushing me to reach my potential. he gave great advice, encouragement and support which massively helped me gain confidence in my ability.  if you want to take your fitness to the next level, i highly recommend working with daniel!"
3,2023-02-11,Basic but has all the gear I need,"basic but has all the gear i need. lockers are a mess, though and 1 of the showers has had a dodgy door for months!"
5,2023-02-11,Classes are great,"classes are great, jess is always friendly and supportive. the equipment is always clean, tidy and easy to use. just love it!!"
5,2023-02-11,Bletchley gym has improved loads,"bletchley gym has improved loads. i now attend this gym much more than the other 2 in milton keynes! the cycle classes are creative, innovative, advanced and engaging! one instructor (m, female) i met for the first time, she took note of my name and she encouraged me during the class. she was amazing, sadly her classes are around 1pm so can’t go due to work. bletchley is rocking, trust me, i’ve attended all three! bletchley now has the best classes, they listened to their customers!"

5,2023-02-11,Just attended my induction,"just attended my induction.  kyle was excellent,  he took the time to explain everything and answered all my questions.  made me feel at home in an unknown environment.  thanks"
1,2023-02-10,New closing times were a mistake,"just leaving a review here to echo others sentiments about closing time - 10pm is a joke and 8pm at weekends is worse. at the very least, it should be open till midnight - tescos nearby can manage that, why not puregym? and now its really busy all the time due to condensed opening hours, plus the constant rearrangement of equipment - i spend half the time trying work out where things are now."
4,2023-02-11,The spin classes are amazing,"the spin classes are amazing! the instructors make them fun and create a great atmosphere. the morning ones are a great way to start the day. a new class has started at midday on a saturday, with a good mix of pumping vibes. if there were more morning and afternoon classes i would give 5 stars. keep up the good work!"

5,2023-02-11,Great gym,"great gym , classes and staff"
1,2023-02-11,Poor decision made by the gym,absolutely ridiculous decision made by pg canary a wharf to not have the gym open 24/7. they did not even have a courtesy to decrease the membership price due to reduced opening hours. i will not be renewing my monthly membership and will join a different gym that treats their members fairly.
4,2023-02-11,Why are the music so loud,why are the music so loud? every class the instructor put the music so loud that i usually have headaches after the class.
1,2023-02-11,Unreasonable opening times,heaving during the day. changed from 24/7 to limited hours without a reduction in price. all complaints are met with a generic copy and pasted response about low usage overnight. of course it’s going to be less busy at 3am?! but closing at 8pm on the weekend is ridiculous. castle marina is unsuitable for me. will be joining the gym.
5,2023-02-11,Loving the gym and classes!,loving the gym and classes
3,2023-02-11,Pull your fingers out please!,is it too much for pure gym to get some repairs done? tv’s out of action at the harrogate branch for weeks on end and worn leather pads on some of the equipment. surely there’s enough profit made from the members?
5,2023-02-10,The staff are always on hand,"the staff are always on hand, the equipment is, the majority of the time working and at a good standard."
5,2023-02-11,👍Cool gym,"im not sure why this gym has bad rating. such a great gym, excellent ladies section with most equipment what more can you ask for? not many gyms offer womens section with good equipment, and cheap membership, so thanks for this, 5* from me."
5,2023-02-09,Cant really complain about company as i…,"cant really complain about company as i go no contract for 16.99 off peak. im using it during night time when there is still around 30 people on average at 3am, wish there were even less people than that, but thats nothing to do with pure gym as understandably they want as much money as they can get to be able to operate. only thing to improve is to have showers and locker rooms functional 24/7 rather than being shut between 3-7am."
5,2023-02-10,Good,"first time going today and the trainer (i think it was matthew?) gave me the induction, very friendly and made to feel welcome as was anxious about going, the other staff seem helpful and made sure to check how i was getting on, my only issue is the fan filters on the treadmills could do with a clean, other than that it was a good experience, clean and tidy throughout"
3,2023-02-10,The gym is fine,"the gym is fine, it’s just the female changing rooms make me want to puke. not sure if it’s anything to do with the pipes in the showers or not but it genuinely smells like someone’s ate beans and farted. i can’t stand the smell. it’s an on going issue too."
1,2023-02-10,Whoever had the idea to trial these new…,"whoever had the idea to trial these new opening times, was the worst idea ever had by anyone ever lol"
5,2023-02-10,My personal experience,"i have a personal trainer called christina fox she is so inspiring and would recommend her to anyone. she is motivational, supportive, has heart of gold and encourages you to push yourself to your goals. i also attend her extra classes e.g. sweat 30 and her own personal all womens class. she challenges us and pushes us out our comfort zone to give us a better outcome and im so appreciative of everything she does. she always replies to me asap making sure i get all the answers i need and knows how to pick me up when i have down days. pure gym wouldnt be amazing without her."
3,2023-02-09,Please sort the Temperature/AirCon,gym is great. pts and classes also great. just need to get your aircon/temperature sorted. its not fun working out when its too cold to take your sweat top off. many people are finding it too cold. you went from too warm to too cold. please can you sort the temperature out. then feedback would have been 5 starts
5,2023-02-10,Back to 24/7 plus epic refit,update wooohoooo  back to 24/7  plus a refit  very very happy. all is looking fresh and i can do anytime!  thankyou for changing the hours back much appreciated

5,2023-02-10,AFFORDABLE ALMOST PERFECT GYM,"friendly atmosphere, plenty of space and plenty of everything. very affordable. but....this gym does need more mirrors as you are not able to form check which could lead to a injury, also no wifi for the customer but they have it for staff? i would recommend this gym."

1,2023-02-08,My son attended the gym and had all of…,"my son attended the gym and had all of his items stolen within the mens changing rooms. it has come to light that he is not the only one within borehamwood gym that this has happened to. i emailed pure gym to highlight my concern to be sent a generic email back from some automated system. i find this absolutely disgraceful that my concerns about this gym and peoples pesonal property is being stolen from locked and secure lockers, plus the staff really dont care has not been taken seriously. shame on you pure gym owners. its clearly just about money and not your clients!  follow on to reply from pure gym again you obviously didnt read the post. from secure and locked lockers!"
2,2023-02-09,Terrible,"terrible. this gym doesnt compete to fire house fitness: its pointlessly spacious, the bathrooms stinks of faeces, some of the machines had a yellow mold, the weight floor had a pointlessly long half wall for no reason. there was only 6 different pieces of equipment for the weight area, most being cable machines, the shoulder machine is uncomfortable. the instructions on the shoulder machine are on the hinge that stands the chair up. the cable machines top hinge is way to short. now the cardio experience isnt as bad, but i did only use 1 machine because of the lack of quality in the weight area. the cardio bikes are just uncomfortable. they are just way too small and with a little weight it feels as if it will just fall flat on its side.  the weight machines had a weird amount of resistance, sometimes the machine would just slide up with little strength needed. even on higher weights that i shouldnt be capable of using, over time the resistance just felt weird, when using the rope for the triceps most of the resistance was putting the weight back instead of pulling it out.  i dont understand the hype, im guessing the reviews are from people that have never went to another gym, so they have no comparison, but even a home gym could do 1 better as at least you can keep it hygienic enough to not have a built-up cheese mold on a machine.  overhyped. if you want to take exercise seriously, go anywhere else."
5,2023-02-09,Open All Hours - Friendly Gym,"staff are welcoming & approachable. open 24hrs so fits in around work schedule. parking directly outside of gym making it feel safer when attending outside hours. non intimidating. only negative, is too many people on equipment at peak times."
5,2023-02-09,Fantastic place,excellent place for exercise and good customer service
5,2023-02-09,Absolutely great gym,"absolutely great gym. lovely team of staff, all so friendly, welcoming and willing to help. classes are great! wide range of classes and always availability. get started and workshops to learn how to use equipment which is very beneficial. would definitely recommend :))"
4,2023-02-09,Great gym for the price…,i’ve been using this gym for a while and the staff are very friendly and try their best to maintain the gym clean so as a public member i think it’s also our duty to return our equipment after using it.

1,2023-02-01,I've had the worst experience in THIS…,"ive had the worst experience in this puregym, which is a shame as ive been a loyal member for over 5 years now. the changing rooms are absolutely terrible and in the worst conditions, not to mention unsafe too! the towels are so dirty and the manager is frankly rude. i will defiantly be reconsidering my subscription next month."
1,2023-02-09,at acton puregym spinning class,"at acton puregym spinning class, the loudest music ever i can’t even hear my own headphones, i had to leave as my ears started suffering. it’s should be a limit for the noise or have consideration for others. worst exprience ever"

4,2023-02-09,"Great gym generally, poor showers","great gym, great equipment and ive never had any issues with anyone there. everyone ive spoken to has been friendly, its a good atmosphere in general and i like training here. the only thing letting it down are the showers, there is no temperature control and all but one of them are always scalding hot which sounds petty but actually makes a huge difference to how i feel after a workout not being able to have a comfortable shower. the showers are cleaner this year but last autumn they were very dirty and smelly as well, there was a used plaster in one of the showers and i saw it several days in a row showing that they hadnt been cleaned properly in days."

2,2023-02-09,Overcrowded and Messy,overcrowded and messy. you spend more time looking for the plates than actually training. i visit a different puregym every week due to work and this is one of the messiest i’ve seen. i get that this is basic gym etiquette but it clearly isn’t suggested here in any way. lots of cardio machines which aren’t all used . shame the weights area could do with expanding as you’re almost cueing to deadlift / find space to hipthrust. upside is people seem nice.
5,2023-02-08,Pump Class,did a pump class at 6.15pm with megan and it was my first ever class! she was really good and very engaging with an entire class full. i would recommend her classes! it’s a shame i’m only here for business as would love to go again! thank you megan for helping with the first time nerves!

3,2023-02-08,Too many broken lockers,"so when are the lockers going to be repaired??  the response is obviously a generic reply and not from someone from the gym. if you are, where is the suggestion box, as i cant find one. this is brierley hill.    good gym since the refurbishment. but when are the lockers going to be repaired in the mens changing rooms? so many have broken catches and are not useable. this has got worse over the last month. not exactly secure."
1,2023-02-08,This gym is far to small for the amount…,"this gym is far to small for the amount of members it has - colchester  the last few weeks when i have been in the gym i have not been able to get on anything. i’ve not been able to get a bench in the functional area, weights, a barbell or even dumbbells of the weight i need. upstairs the machines are always busy and taken and there seems to be a lot of youngsters gathering in big groups hogging equipment and it’s quite intimidating as well. this gym is far too packed for you to be able to do a full session. even going into the classes room, which is lovely, but it needs a bench and dumbbells in it.  in response to the below reply - when you work a 9-5 job it’s impossible to get to the gym during the day around peak times therefore the fact numbers fluctuate during the day does not make a difference for me as it’s simply not an option. i check the app every single time i go to the gym and i don’t think i have ever seen it been below 70 people whether it be during peak hours, non peak hours or over the weekend. this gym is simply not big enough for the amount of members it has."

1,2023-02-08,Absolute disgusting,"i am just appalled how you got a staff member who goes by the name christina is going into the back carpark and is smoking weed by the footpath that gym members use to walk up to the gym. it is absolute disgusting and stunk out the whole carpark with this horrible smell. this was around 11.45 on 08/02/23, there is cctv at that location and was right near the fire exit to other businesses at this park. she obviously wasn’t professional as she was wearing her work uniform  there was actually a member who walked past and had to cover his nose with his clothing. you got members that are experiencing behaviour like this! let me remind you this is a gym where people are working on bettering themselves and fitness yet you have a staff member that is abusing drugs right in front of them. is this what you call professional and a representative to your organisation? is this what pure gym stands for?  this same staff member is loud, extremely rude and has an attitude problem where she behaves like she owns the gym. at first i thought she was the gym manager, come to find out she is just a member of staff that cannot do her job properly or even behave professional as there has been many conflicts or incidents that involve her. other staff members are polite and the gym manager is actually a lovely gentlemen who is very helpful and always there to give a helping hand to members.  it is shocking you have someone like this who is actually taking drugs whilst at work and then working with people around equipment, this is a hazard to workplace as she would not be in the right state of mind. your staff should have a duty of care as you are dealing with people and gym equipment. any mistake can cause fatal injuries.  looking at previous reviews it is clear christina cannot do this job and there seems to be a reoccurring trend.  i do not recommend anyone to train with christina as firstly she does not have the right state of mind due to the influence of drugs and how can you take fitness advise of someone like this and secondly she is not professional so your wasting your money.  also you maybe contacted by the police as i spoke to an old lady who was shopping in the car park at the same time and could not believe such behaviour in broad day light. she has reported this to the police  i would suggest the manager to be notified of this behaviour and kindly ask pure gym to make sure staff members are given random blood test to ensure the safety of their gym members."
5,2023-02-08,Pure Gym is a great place to work out,"pure gym is a great place to work out! they have a good variety of classes with great instructors. price is reasonable, especially that it includes all the classes. im going there for a few month now about 4 times a week, and im really enjoying it :)"
1,2023-01-30,AVOID: Taken advantage of and charged £100 for parking,"after using this gym for around a year there seems to have been recent changes to parking regulations for the gym. i work out every three days or so and do long workouts so i usually spend 2.5+ hours in the gym.  i recently spent over three hours at the gym for one of my long workouts and have been given a £100 fine for parking longer then 2.5 hours.  there is nowhere to purchase a ticket for longer parking and paying £100 to park at the gym is absolutely inexcusable and i imagine if the gym doesnt do anything about this there will be a significant decrease in the number of people using this gym.  i will be using a different gym that doesnt charge £100 pounds for parking which any reasonable person would agree is laughable, ignorant and greed fueled.  this has never happened before and at the date of this incident i didnt see any signs indicating of this parking restriction and since this wasnt always the case i didnt think to look for signs about parking since before this new ""parking charge"" was implemented i was able to park for free"

3,2023-02-07,Overall good but one major downfall,"we joined pure gym just before christmas as was previously a member of 24/7 fitness when they were there. gym in terms of location and facilities is good, but very disappointed with the opening times especially at the weekend, saturday 8am to 4pm is ridiculous, sunday 10 to 4pm is no better most other gyms in wisbech and pure gyms in the area are open much longer hours some are 24 hour access. we will stick with it for a bit longer but probably will look elsewhere."

5,2023-02-08,Verry nice experience,"verry nice experience, neringa give me  motivation to continue training. some weeks it is hard to stay motivated, neringa has really kept me moving. her cheerful attitude makes the training time go quickly.she is always cheerful and while she pushes hard to get us to our goals. puregym team they are verry nice people, helpfull and motivated. mihaela"

1,2023-02-02,Shocking customer service,shocking customer service! still waiting over 5 days for a reply/action! dealing over twitter/email is useless where your staff just fob us off! plus the main issue of inducing a sign up before the offer ends only to put a better offer on the next day!

1,2023-02-07,Rude Staff (management),been a paying member here for a few years now and wasnt expecting to be spoken to so rudely today. i went in very briefly with my little one to speak to a member of staff and got rudely stopped by an awful cover manager today. told me that i could lose my membership over popping in for a brief moment just because i had to bring my child in with me. what would you like me to do? leave her out in the cold by herself? i understand that its not a safe place for children but we were there to speak to staff very quickly. you could have been much more polite considering ive been paying and attending that gym for a long time. rude rude rude. life is way too short.. it doesnt hurt to be polite and kind!

1,2023-02-05,"Too busy for the size, some have no respect for the equipment and tiktok kids literally running around","gave this a try as it was a 24/7 gym and was £17.99pm for 3 montha and not joining fee. however thats all thags good thing about this gym. now for the negative, during staffed hours its way too busy, you end up waiting for machines as there’s too many people due to the cheap price, 160 people at one point. when there’s only one machine for certain workouts, you wait longer for it then you spend it. when the unstaffed hours start however it starts to slow down. until that is, the spoilt groups of teenagers start appearing between 11pm and 1am. what do they do? play hide and seek and chase each other around between the machines. using the equipment like pillocks as they saw another pillock on tiktok. along with the people that just don’t care about the equipment, leaving weights and benches on the other end of the gym.  in summary, it’s great if you go late at night if you don’t mind tiktok kids treating it like a playground and searching for the equipment you need to use."
1,2023-02-05,I used to go to this gym every day,"i used to go to this gym every day, it was my second home, but unfortunately the opening hours has been changed , sadly it’s not 24 hours anymore. the gym now is closing at 10pm which is the time i finish work , i can’t use the one in london road because of the safety , i don’t feel safe to park my car there.  unfortunately i’m going to change this gym just because of the time as many people did, will i don’t like to but i have to ."

4,2023-02-03,Great new addition,great new addition. plenty of squat racks. open plan and spacious.  minor quibble with puregym: they seem to prefer the concept bike to the assault bike. that’s a minor quibble though.
1,2023-02-04,No longer open at the time I can go,"very poor decision for puregym to remove 24/7 opening gym, (its one of the main reason i joined). and the reason they provided is illogical. if its not busy during the times they say, why does it open even later and closer earlier? make this make sense."

5,2023-01-04,Overall Great GYM,"ive been to most of the pure gyms in london and stratford pure gym with ilford ranks up top in my opinion.  on the plus side its big, all modern and fully equipped. convenient and easy access. thankfully so far, people are respectful enough to not leave weights and equipment lying about. i hope management remains strict and on top of this. equipment all over the place is untidy, a hazard, and it becomes annoying to try and find kit if its not in its proper place. theres enough free weights and machines here so that you can always find some time to work on without downtime. but obviously if you work out at busier times your experience may vary.  some minor issues. another previously has already covered cleaning stations, there are none, would be useful. ive spotted people come into the toilets and wrap toilet paper in their hand and use that, obviously making a mess, so some paper towels and gel would be helpful to everyone. the studio at the back is a wi-fi dead zone. its a pity that puregym doesnt provide wifi, but if youre on your phone and trying to track your workout or download some music, walking into the studio in the back means you cant connect to network, so you have to walk back out again to try and connect. a minor annoyance.  lastly, because its all open plan, there not any areas to work on kettlebells or dumbbells that arent enclosed. not everyone feels comfortable working out, in front of everyone. if youre the kind of person that wants to do your thing in your own little corner, youre out of luck. the other day i wanted to work out with kettlebells and went into the studio, but had to leave because a class was starting. i then went onto the main floor and had to move again because a circuit class was starting.  again, just minor issues, i can live with it and hopefully some workarounds or solutions can be found. overall a great gym."
5,2023-02-04,"Awesome gym, with a great environment :)","the location is great, easily accessible via public transport or car. the machines available are good and are maintained/replaced if and when needed. good range of classes available at different times on different days. staff are helpful and enthusiastic with any questions asked of them. pt’s are also awesome, with incredible knowledge on different workouts/nutrition to meet whatever goals you have.  it’s definitely one of the most welcoming gyms i’ve been to and i’m definitely happy with it.  thank you pg staff for getting me back on the right track again 💚"
2,2023-02-02,Nice gym but still no cleaning stations…,"the gym is new and beautiful but, after one month since it opened, there are still no cleaning stations yet. its also written in their rules, specifically on rule number 13 of puregym. ill give them 5 stars when this important hygiene issue will be solved because the people who work there are very nice and professional."
1,2023-02-04,A gym full of potential if it had the…,"a gym full of potential if it had the right team to manage it. went to the gym two saturdays in a row, now, and most rowers had no batteries. ridiculous. constantly, machines are broken in this gym, which makes me lose time and make my life difficult as i cant really follow my program properly. the only reason im still coming is because is close to my house but given the time im wasting waiting for the non broken machines, or reprogramming my session, i might as well join a further away one. they simply dont care about anything else but the numbers. stay away if you can."
3,2023-02-03,I love  the gym but 😅,"i love the gym, good equipment,it is a pity that there is no seated leg curl, back extension machineand,aura rotary torso and steppers, also i dont like the cross trainers next to the main entry and is extremely cold, i thing should be more then one water station, and is no wi-fi"
1,2023-02-04,CHANGE BACK THE OPENING TIMES,"considering the ammount of people complaining about the new opening times, this seems like a simple thing to change back? or at least open a lot earlier then what is currently being offered? makes no sense to not be 24/7, this was literally your main selling point. plus, the main reason for changing was the underused gym at night. 1. people are complaining about this change, so it was used. 2. so you want everyone to go into a crowded gym at peak times? so nobody really gets to enjoy it? just change back, or change to say 4am opening 12am closing. what you have done makes no sense at all."
5,2023-02-01,Great new gym,"great new gym. classes well run by knowledgeable and helpful teachers, if a little crowded for the space.  be great to have pilates and or yoga added too"
1,2023-02-02,Worst Smelling Gym!,"the gym has been smelling so bad recently. such a strong and disgusting odour which does not go, the gym really needs an ac or just something to help with the smell. makes me want to vomit!!"
5,2023-01-26,1 legged warrior,"as an amputee i sometimes struggle going to new places and i know the gym can seem quite daunting. mel the manager met me at the entrance and instantly made me feel at ease. the other staff members are also very friendly and more than approachable, and are always happy to help with a smile. the gym is well equipped and even in my wheelchair there is plenty of space to move around. the disabled shower room and toilet are also roomy enough for most with access needs to maneuver around. highly recommended."

Never again,"pure gym!!! eevsham- always full, no space or enough equipment to work, instructors and personal trainers not lasting longer than two months. had premium membership as i travel for work. even paying extra i couldnt access all gyms in other locations. they asked me to upgrade my membership to an even higher one. i have frozen my membership in august last year and asked them to cancel my membership. in november realized they have been charging me every month. asked for a refund as i didnt visit the gym once in the last 4 months - they refused. in january realised they still been charging me for the gym even after i asked twice to cancel my membership. i had to call my bank to stop them from taking money off my account. never again. schamy on you puregym"
2,2023-02-03,Not quite sure what’s happening with…,"not quite sure what’s happening with the cleaners but i was in the gym just before 5am today and the gym was filthy, black bags under the stairs, rubbish everywhere, the studio back doors left open where anyone could walk in from the back. absolutely terrible. quite shocking really and i’ve been at beckton for 2 years and never seen it so bad"
5,2023-02-02,Nice job guys!,"never did i think i would say this about a gym but i literally love this place. the staff are awesome, kelly is a fab personal trainer, she had pushed me to be able to do things i never thought i would achieve and been a massive part of my weightloss journey which is currently at 3.5 stone. classes are great, brilliant energy from all of the staff with the great recent addition of joe, who is a super laugh and really encouraging. ive made some amazing friends here, the equipment is usually in good working order and if something does need some repair, it is attended to quickly. it is never so busy that you cant complete a workout, but i like the app feature that lets you check how many people are at the gym before you attend. nice job guys."
5,2023-02-02,10/10,"puregym in oxford templars is an exceptional place to workout. it is proficiently well taken care of; from the regular maintenance of equipment and spaces, to the meticulous cleanliness promoted at every instance.  many gyms in ones local area may boast state of the art equipment and low prices, however very few are able to provide a welcoming, encouraging environment conducive to a good workout. puregym in oxford templars, is among those few. staff are both patient and passionate when attending to members, with no task or query being too trivial. particularly of note is chris ntezi, who has been kind, inspiring, and informative in my every meeting with him. i have learnt a great deal and would not be where i am without his aid. my experiences with other staff members have been congruent to this.  i cannot recommend this gym enough. the only regret for those singing up, is that they wish they had done it sooner."
5,2023-02-02,I lovs this new gym,"i love this new gym! it is huge, so you dont feel crowded. there are plenty of machines, so the work out is always pleasant. no need to wait around. the personnel is amazing as well. big thanks to gm daniel giratta and assist.gm george theodosiou as well as maxime delacour and alina neamt."
4,2023-02-01,The new gym,"the gym is new, all the machines are there, but the water tap and sink in the mens bathroom, there is no much space between the tap, and the bottom of the sink, so to wash your hands you touch the bottom of the sink, and that is no good, the other thing is, the entrance door to the  mens bathroom, close 12am and only opens 3am automatically, now tell me, how can one use the toilet in those 3 hours??? also there is no one  to help you there from 10pm, and there is no paper towels around, to clean the machine after the other person has used."
5,2023-02-02,Great classes,"great classes, instructors are really engaging and motivating, everyone in the classes have been really friendly which is amazing. the facilities are excellent, it does get busy so i just check the app and work around it however i’ve never had any issues not being able to access equipment even in busy times. price is great too"

4,2023-02-02,Well equipped gym,the gym is large and is equipped with a good range of equipment. the entrance system is easy to navigate. the whole place was very clean. the only let down for me was that the changing room is very small and the gym was far too warm.

4,2023-02-01,For being a budget gym it's really…,"for being a budget gym its really huge, three floors, a star trek holodeck like virtual studio. most of the machine you may need and some extra functional areas. clean and nice locker rooms. even though im a very needy gym goes (need rings, a proper real high bar etc) i was very surprised. not a 5 star because the locker room door will be locked between midnight and 3am so no bathroom -the only one outside was out of order- and its not clear what would happen after door gets locked. what happens if i get in at 11pm and i forget about that? shall i wait four hours in order to go back to my locker? what happens if i am inside the locker when the door is shut?"

1,2023-02-01,I would have given this gym a 5…,"i would have given this gym a 5 previously (been coming here about 4 years). it used to be the less rough/noisy/intimidating sister to london greenwich, the staff used to be so friendly & upstairs there was not loud music blaring. yeah those days are gone. i was there this evening the music was unbearably loud upstairs, last week there was a young man rapping at the top of his voice the whole time i was in there ( i could hear him clearly through noise cancelling headphones) and the assistant said not one word to him. theres so many things wrong that im cancelling. such a disappointment its become like london greenwich which is frightful."

5,2023-02-01,Amazing instructor,"really pleased with the new gym at the carlton centre, lincoln. nicole is a great instructor and i always thoroughly enjoy her classes. tonight, an external instructor unfortunately didn’t turn up, so she stepped in and taught a class so everyone hadn’t had a wasted journey, meaning she taught 3 classes back to back. she’s also stepped in on a weekend when another instructor wasn’t able to turn up. she’s an asset to this gym!"

5,2023-02-01,An amazing gym!,"an amazing gym!  toilets, showers and changing always bleached clean which i am a huge fan of.  gym is always tidy as the staff are constantly putting back equipment people leave out.  friendly atmosphere with a wide age range.  plenty of equipment meaning that even in peak times there is something to use or go on.  it’s a big gym so when you are not feeling confident or want some space there is always somewhere you can tuck yourself away. allowing you to do a workout on the app or go solo"
1,2023-01-30,The gym is longer 24/7 anymore,the gym is longer 24/7 anymore. this was the only reason i choose this gym! they opened access to limehouse branch but i was declined to enter on 30/01 and got a message this gym isnt available to me.
5,2023-02-01,Excellent gym and lovely staff,have been going to puregym for over a year now. recently added the london wall gym to my membership and its brilliant. well maintained and a lovely team running the gym. so nice to do my workouts there.
5,2023-02-01,Excellent,"the location is excellent, its very well equipped and the staff are present, but not in any way pushy. it gets busy between 12-1.45pm and 5pm to 6.45pm monday to friday. usually outside of these times you only queue for the flat bench! this will be a successful branch and i fully expect it to double in size within the next 18 months."

1,2023-01-31,I wish I'd read the reviews…,"i wish id read the reviews before i signed up for a gym membership here as i certainly would have thought again. as others have said its all set up for body-building with only three exercise bikes, and all of very poor quality. most of the classes are all about weights too, and theres no spin classes which is important for me -  although there are a couple of very nice spin bikes on the gym floor and the puregym app has some great spin video workouts you could use - if only there was good wifi in the gym like you do get in other puregyms. all the cross-training machines are right next to each other - this is far too close and i think i may have caught covid from the man next to me who was coughing a lot. in the world we live in, nobody wants to exercise on top of strangers. as a semi-professional athlete any cold or virus can have devastating consequences for my training. as others have said, the male cleaner walking in and out of the open plan female changing room is a terrible idea - its feels creepy, and uncomfortable and i had to take to changing and showering at home before and after they gym. in addition, they advertise free parking, but two and a bit hours just isnt long enough for a good workout...."
1,2023-02-01,Arrived 5.35am to access gym as…,arrived 5.35am to access gym as advertised 24 hour all website and across all marketing. waited and waited and informed at 5.55 by staff member that gym doesnt open until 6am. pretty poor considering all pure gyms are 24 hours and nothing mentioned across any media
1,2023-01-31,BEWARE! DANGEROUS GYM AND NOT A SAFE GYM FOR WOMEN  STAFF MEMBERS WILL GET AWAY WITH TOUCHING/ GROPING  WOMEN INAPPROPRIATELY AND DOING CLASSES DRUNK BUT NO ACTION WILL BE TAKEN  AT BLACKBURN PUREGYM,"i would not recommend this gym to anyone. staff members will speak to you rudely and treat you like rubbish, never  any words of encouragement during classes from them. they will make you feel uncomfortable and isolated in class, and ignored, like you dont exist, and wont treat you equally, so you stop attending them, then they wont have to carry out the class. male staff members will come to work drunk, touch women inappropriately, and threaten members, but no action will be taken against them, instead members will get punished. one particular staff member, who acts like shes a diva, will constantly go on her phone, look in the mirror, continue talking to gym members during classes. when you complain to head of members  ceo  and md  theyll just make an excuse and try to fob you off by stating, theyre just having personel issues. so theyre allowed to bring their personel issues to work and take it out on gym members!. theyll also blame you and state, youre overthinking it. no point complaining because they wont believe you. gym staff members werent adhering to the rules and slacking. they were cancelling classes constantly at short notice, when youve made an effort to travel to the gym.  they werent even prepared to do classes for either 2/3 people. its just beyond a joke!. head of member, ceo  and md, dont give a damn about gym members and wont take your complaint seriously, or consider this a serious matter, despite members complaining to gym manager, about their concerns regarding this serious matter with male staff members touching womens buttocks and two gym members providing statements to head of member. a lot of members left puregym after this incident. head of member will respond by stating their behaviour is nothing personel, when it is!. this is the reason  i was afraid to complain, and wanted to remain anonymous, because  staff members will take revenge when you complain about them, because theyre not happy being forced to do the classes and remain angry during classes, and cant even be bothered to carry out the class properly. theyll treat you nastily in class, and  speak to you rudely and single you out.  theyre aware they can get away with it no action will be taken, so will continue doing this. no wonder the classes are always empty, with this kind of behaviour and attitude from staff members. head of member must be delusional if she thinks this is the busiest gym. the bikes in the spin studeo are never in  working order, you have to keep switching bikes, its very disruptive during a class. management cant  be bothered getting the bikes repaired until a complaint is made. theyll cancel classes, so they can have their private pt sessions, to earn more money rather than do a class. ive been told theyre investigating, and footages have been checked by regional manager, but theres nothing out of the ordinary.  theyve not bothered to check the footage  properly or fobbing me off as usual. the regional manager is useless. he didnt have a clue that  staff were breaking rules, including managers. md ceo will never take action against puregym staff only members. staff member would get away even if male staff members raped a gym member. ceo head of members  and md  condone this kind of behaviour because they cant find staff, everyone keeps leaving and theyre already short staffed. worst gym in blackburn. disgraceful/zero customer service. ladies beware! not a safe gym for women because if a puregym staff groped you, you wont get justice.  the groper/drunk, is still in the gym. if you complain, your complaint wont be taken seriously or your membership will be terminated, if footage is checked, they wont find anything. puregym cant even afford  extra staff or to repair the microphone, bikes, and ac, which is never in working order, but happy to take your money. unprofessional staff, slapper whose bad mouthing me to a gym member, when boyfriend cheated and got her pregnant, she came crying to me. they were  bad mouthing another gym member on how bad he smells. when head of member found out staff wernt following rules, her response was, it happens, it shouldnt happen, then members wouldnt have to complain! lazy, rude, unprofessional staff who cant be bothered /interested in doing the classes properly. worst gym in blackburn. staff members dont comply with the rules, so are capable of any thing. theyll never get rid of staff. members get slagged off. if you complain about a staff theyll take it personally, and will misbehave in class. they wont show you any empathy. gym is a shambles going down hill its a toxic environment where your mental health will be affected.  dangerous rubbish stingy gym and not value for money. caren anderton sonya others r paid by puregym to write fake 5 star reviews for them."
5,2023-01-31,"A friendly, well run Gym","i have been a member for several months now. i have been weight training for many years. the gym is always very clean and the equipment is well maintained. if something breaks its usually mended pretty quickly. i like the way members respect each others space and keep the training areas tidy. it always feels a safe friendly space, where you are free to carry out your own routines in your own time."
1,2023-01-31,The gym offers free parking- NOT true,"the gym offers free parking, but twice in 10 days my voucher from the gym has been invalid on the paying machines and i’ve had to pay £1.70. also, the gym has no wi-fi unlike the old one. finally, the treadmills are infront of the window so everyone walks past and stares in, very uncomfortable i’ll be moving gyms."
1,2023-01-20,24/7 changed to 12/7,"the change away from 24/7 is insane, the gym is not poorly equipped exactly, but the quality isnt great, lights, plumbing, cleanliness are all relatively poor. in summer it gets incredibly stuffy.  all this is forgivable to me if not for the fact they took away 24/7 access.  i signed up to this gym specifically because of the 24/7 aspect, i work in hospitality and its the same story for the guys i work with. i cannot go to the gym on the weekend now, and the times i can go in the week its so packed its not worth it at all. i wouldnt pay £5 a month for this. i am cancelling my subscription."
1,2023-01-31,I cannot give them 1 star,"i cannot give them 1 star. absolutely disgusting. dirty, full (on a normal tuesday was showing 199 people) i mean cmoooon!!!! that’s outrageous. no equipment free at no point except weekends. boys, teenagers take over all equipment and do f*** all, they are allowed to wear office shirts and trousers, including office shoes while working out. nobody ever pays attention. you could die in there and no member of staff would realise. it’s too full to see if someone ever needs helps. just today was trying to fill out my water bottle and saw a piece of chewing gum spit in the water tank. really? bathrooms are filthy. gym just opened and machines are already damaged and faulty. no thank you."
1,2023-01-23,Thieves operate at this gym,"second week at this gym and my locker was broken into. they stole my phone and tried accessing my bank accounts. luckily the thieves are dumb. won’t be stepping foot into that gym. avoid at all costs.  edit after response: your terms don’t change the fact that you have thieves roaming around. moreover, i wasn’t asking for anything. this review is to let others know and be cautious. thanks."
5,2023-01-31,"Legs, bums n tums","great gym, clean and friendly. legs bums n tums today was the best class of its type i have done! instructor was top man 😁"
1,2023-01-31,Doesn't even deserve a star,"doesnt even deserve a star, joined here last week, every day went in the gym is busier than the shop. couldnt move couldnt get on anything. really needs to have a limit on how many allowed in per time unbelievable, canceled membership"
1,2022-12-18,Parking Ticket,"got a ticket at the crown wharf car park after joining this pure gym because the parking code i used was invalid. even tried two codes and both were invalid - this was at10:30pm so there were no staff who could assist.  avoid this gym if you train late because you will end up with a parking ticket either because the code they will give you will be invalid or the machine that prints the code will be playing up.  edit - i have spoken to one of the staff at puregym and they have advised they will provide evidence of my parking times which should resolve the parking fine. if this is the case then i will gladly change my review but until then, the parking situation is making it difficult to recommend training here. edit 2 - still 2 months later i am still being harassed by the parking company even with evidence i was using the gym and the parking codes were invalid. puregym has been absolutely no help what so ever, even though they clearly have the power to cancel my ticket.  on top of that the gym facilities are actually awful."
1,2023-01-25,PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR MEMBERS,as you could see members are utterly dismayed by the unprecedented change in closing time . we choose this gym because of its location and 24hr opening time conferring degree of flexibilities . how the management dealt with the issue is not the best approach even at corporate level . not much notice just a blatant note on social media. that’s how they value their members. i don’t think they care if you switch to a different gym. it’s far from perfect the state of the gym to start with but the new announcement is  just taking the p&£s to the max. the management cited saving electricity and manpower as among the issues they faced with low usage during those hours .. well check with other puregym across the country i’m sure they are no different. i train at puregym all over the country because of work .. never heard their closing time changed  .. perhaps you should try harder promoting your gym to the local community to boost your members’ numbers rather then neglecting it with a  lack-lustrous upkeep  that doesn’t do existing members any justice at all . oh yes why not go to puregym london road .. you must be kidding .. the gym is a war zone .. wooden panelled ceiling with leaking water with condensation over the mirror  opposite the weights area you can’t see a thing you may even forget how you look like after 10 minutes . full of juvenile trigger happy kids who used it as their playground and social hub . the area is not central or  very safe at night with notable undesirable characters on the prowl . inside it’s a definite health hazard.. if the health inspector paid a visit it won’t pass the health and safety test to operate. the pungent smell of damp that filled the air is enough to intoxicate anyone . worst of all members still paid the same amount despite the changed closing time .  no word of apologies no corporate incentive for members to stay…even the responses on trustpilot are generic  cut and paste ..  might as well close the gym at brighton central it’s easier .the staffs are excellent in general  including the managers but they are powerless against  the higher managerial decision. they had to endure all the disgruntled members rebuke as you could imagine but in general they are awesome. they had been a petition circulating around i think someone is writing to the local mp and the local newspaper about this . it’s time the management listen and value it’s members .. why not open till 12am week days and later during the weekend ? it’s time to listen .. we love this gym it’s far from perfect but we make it perfect as our home gym over the years . your kind consideration is much appreciated.
1,2023-01-17,"Not for regular gym goers, just iron pumpers","i normally go to puregyms at home in the midlands  and they are fantastic value for money, with great no frills facilities. i visited this gym whilst on a long work trip in the area and wasnt impressed. its not a proper puregym as its mostly just weights with very little cardio equipment. for this reason, it seems like whoever set it up has only had experience of small seedy gyms that cater to iron pumping, and gym candy users rather than bigger more commercial gyms that are targeted to regular members of the public. towards the end of my trip i went to try the uni of bangor gym, which was much better and let me just do pay as you go."
1,2023-01-30,Disappointed by timing change - Beeston PureGym,"me and my friends were members of this gym, but now we have cancelled our membership because of these recent time changes. the least they could have done was kept the gym open till midnight. we used to always go in the evening, and it wasnt empty, in fact, we would hardly be able to use the equipment because it was so busy.  very disappointed by this pure gym. if the timings are changed back, we would come back to using this gym, as it is in a wonderful location. such a shame about the timing change."
3,2023-01-30,"ok, but really busy","good gym, but a lot of the time most of the useful equipment is occupied. i understand when theres people who want to train/excercise, but what are all those kids doing there? theres teenagers just sitting around on the machines on their phones."
1,2023-01-16,Dishonest advertising,"24hr opening was advertised prominently as a selling point when i signed up on 12th jan. 16th jan they changed the opening hours. this feels very dishonest. they must have known opening hours were changing, but decided to take money from new members under false pretences anyway."
5,2023-01-30,Great gym,this is a fantastic gym. the ladies only area is a great addition to the gym with plenty of space and equipment. the extra leg machines recently added downstairs are a plus especially during busier periods. staff are friendly and are always willing to help when needed. i would definitely recommend this gym to everyone!!!
1,2023-01-30,Kids club,"i have been a member here for about 18 months and im afraid im seeing a slip in standards rather than a improvement and im looking for somewhere else to train. i fully understand you get what you pay for in life and certain times in the gym are busier than others and its a choice as to what time you go. but when your only window is around 430/5 this , unfortunately for me , seems to collide with school kick out times. the gym is swamped with kids/ teenagers id say between ages 14-17. all ""training"" in large groups, loitering around equipment , larking around , 5,6,7 of them at once. most not that interested in training , on their phones , chatting , not even in gym kit.  by the time the 6 of them have all had a little go , with the long group chats between sets , no exaggeration its 30/40 minutes before that equipment is available again.  the gym etiquette of these youngsters is none existent , to the point its almost funny. they all leave the gym without a drop of sweat on them . i dont overly have a problem with the kids , theres nothing else for them to do locally and if you dont know gym etiquette then how can you practice it.  my issue is the staff , gym managers and pts stood there seeing all this and doing/saying nothing. watching them leave equipment everywhere and just cleaning up after them. it screams of a place more interested in getting max numbers through the doors rather than a good training environment for all. im not suggesting kick them all out , we were all new in the gym once , but at least have a word as leaders in the gym to disperse the large groups and improve the etiquette. to summurise if your a new gym goer , can go weekday daytimes ,  or your a youngster looking for somewhere to hang out i would recommend this gym. but if you want any kind of intensive workout , your an immediate or advanced gym goer i really wouldnt recommend, it will just frustrate you and ruin it , your better off paying a bit more or travelling a bit further to get somewhere a bit more serious."
4,2023-01-25,Classes running back to back!,"gym in the main is good, however, some classes run back to back, and often start late due to the previous class clearing equipment away and then long queues for members waiting to start. 10 minutes between would make a huge difference"
2,2023-01-30,The classes have the music and audio…,the classes have the music and audio from pt way too loud. especially on the 30/01/23. multiple people i spoke to didnt appreciate how loud it is. i cant hear my own music nor concentrate on my workout.
5,2023-01-30,Ladies is dopeee,"charile done an amazing job with the ladies area, 10/10 😊"
5,2023-01-30,Amazing service provided by Zee and…,"amazing service provided by zee and charlie. however, i would appreciate more glutes equipments."
5,2023-01-30,Great service,"great service, there are accessible equipment that everyone can use. has a friendly environment. the ladies only section is a plus and very clean."
3,2023-01-29,"Decent gym, not very clean, poor wifi","norwich castle mall. good range of equipment and free weights. good range of classes. gym is clean most of the times, but much poorer standards during weekend. on a recent weekend visit, there were no tissue paper in the male changing room, the changing room floors and gym floors were wet. showers are ok, but no control over the temperature, e.g. if you wanted cold water. no cellular network, but you can connect to o2 wifi, which is aweful during peak times."
5,2023-01-21,Sanaa Arfan Personal Trainer,"sanaa arfan - she has been a great helper and ensuring i feel safe in gym. whenever i have a question or can’t find the equipment she’s super helpful and easy to approach. she’s kind, and has a wonderful demeanour. i would’ve swapped gyms a while ago, but i found comfort in her."
3,2023-01-30,2 things are wrong with your business…,"2 things are wrong with your business model. one if on the faq says you can refer a friend make sure it is actually possible to do so. two if on your website you offer a 0 joining fee code make also sure it works or at least specify which gyms you can get it. allowing people to refer a friend and granting that the referred friend a zero joining fee, is how you are going to get your numbers. joining fees make no sense principally when you do it all online."
4,2023-01-23,It does what it says on the tin,"it does what it says on the tin. it’s a commercial gym full of machines, as one would expect, but also caters for free weights and olympic weightlifting. how could it improve? i would rate it five stars if free car parking was available for over two hours. currently, the car park restricts parking to two hours with a hefty fine for non compliance so beware! ps the actual time is probably measured from entry/exit from the car park so you have to allow say ten minutes on entering and exiting the gym plus a ten minute contingency so actual training time is realistically 90 mins otherwise a £90 penalty notice can be expected. i just joined the gym and can see from my attendances that i have fallen foul of this rule and am awaiting something unpleasant through my letterbox….."
1,2023-01-23,It used to be a great gym…,it used to be a great gym for a morning workout. i used to go 6:15 - 6:30 and it was generally okay. never too busy. this changed recently after the opening hours changed from 24/7 to 6am-10pm on weekdays and 8am-8pm at the weekends. now i find it always way too crowded. no fun anymore. and they didn’t even change the membership cost. being able to access limehouse makes no difference. too far for most. if i wanted to go to limehouse i would have signed up there anyway. i am sure they had their reasons but i am very disappointed…
1,2023-01-29,Membership cannot be cancelled,"membership cannot be cancelled, you can only pause it. it is done on purpose, like an underhanded contract, you can never cancel it. the pause works for a couple of months, and if you forget to pause it next time, you get charged. there is a loop in cancellation process, you are directed to cancellation option which then does not exist. two people in my family have tried to cancel the damn thing, did not find a way to do it. and there is no customer service to discuss the problem. i managed to get in touch via twitter, and they just ignored me afterwards. basically, it is fraud."
5,2023-01-29,Extremely Friendly Gym!!!,"started with serpentine puregym after a couple years not working out at the start of january, have to say the gym is an extremely friendly environment. the pts are very welcoming and more than happy to help you, especially shanaya, and daniela. the gym is always clean, and plenty of space and equipment for you to use even when it’s busy! protein machines are always kept fully stocked too!!! so happy to be visiting here, so much i visit at least 6 days a week!!"
1,2023-01-16,Horrified at the staff,horrified at the staff. serious attitude problem and the extra prancing around gives me anxiety. going by the name of christina who plays music that takes over the gym. then has her own set up using the space by the weights which should be for all the members of the gym to use. i am disgusted and i will be making a formal complaint to management. seriously out of order. that kind of attitude needs to be left at home and not bought into a public place.
2,2023-01-29,Everything about this gym was perfect…,"everything about this gym was perfect for me until they changed the opening hours. i believe this was a terrible decision, going to castle maria just doesnt work for me so had to cancel my membership. if they revert back the 24/7 ill sign straight back up again. listen to your customers guys. if it aint broke dont try to fix it."
2,2023-01-27,Ladies side has had some great changes…,ladies side has had some great changes with extra space and machines. but the pt (christina) has her own rave going on! absolutely shocking why have a private bootcamp in the ladies area when they can use the studio which was free at the time! the extremely loud music is so over powering that she plays ontop of what is already playing via the gym speakers. so distracting..not a happy member at all
5,2023-01-23,Amazing PT Sanaa Arfan,sana arfan is an amazing pt.. fully understands her clients needs and the struggles we face.. really helpful and has lots of knowledge which have really helped me change my way of life when it comes to food and exercise.. a real natural at her job.. who always looks great too!!
5,2023-01-29,Well what can I say sanaa has made me…,well what can i say sanaa has made me achieve my goals so far..hats off to sanaa (personal trainer) for helping me with my journey…she is amazing so polite and caring ❤️ would definitely recommend sanaa as a pt🤩
1,2023-01-28,Stop apologizing and fix it!!!,stop apologizing and fix it!!!! your apologies mean nothing.
4,2023-01-27,I have been going to this gym for a few…,"i have been going to this gym, in warrington north in the wa2 area for a few years now. great gym, and recently the equipment has been upgraded with brand new stuff.  over all id say 4 out of 5.  this is not a criticism and overall the place is clean enough. staff are friendly and they will talk to you. however, i find their body language is to avoid contact. perhaps they could be a bit more welcoming, collaborative and helpful as the feeling i often get is that they dont want engaging much with the members unless they know you or you are a client to they private train 121.  working in the global hr team of a global software business i wanted to explore the possibility of rolling out of pure gym membership to 80 staff in the uk. i have asked the manager once for their sales team to contact me. he did take my details but i am not sure if my request was sent and details were passed. i have not heard anything back from any one yet. sadly there was no follow through by the manager either.  perhaps the floors could be kept cleaner though as there is lot of grit on them. it could be due to winter but then they should may be work a little extra hard or employ an additional cleaner.  also the vents to hvac in mens changing room has a lot of dust settled on the vent plates. this has been accumulating for a while now. and every now and then the fluff drops off which is not great if you have just had a shower.  then there is no clock in mens changing room.  they have also stopped the tvs siting this to be reduction on cost and licensing to play videos etc. however i am a national gym member and i dont see tvs shut elsewhere - atleast to gyms in the other cities i visit."
2,2023-01-29,No longer 24/7 - hugely disappointing,"this used to be fine for a commercial gym, not the best equipment, but decent enough for what you pay. in a great central location in beeston, but now it’s changed its opening hours and is no longer 24/7.  this disadvantages a huge amount of us who prefer very early morning workouts or very late workouts. giving the option of going to castle marina is ridiculous as it isn’t as a convenient location for the majority - therefore need to get public transport or drive to castle marina, putting added cost on top of our memberships. it’s also meant that even the old non-peak times are now busier and you’re still having to wait for equipment - which is the whole reason a lot of us went at different times."
1,2023-01-28,No longer 24 hours,no longer 24 hours. “alternative” gym not has big. change back.
1,2023-01-28,Mis-sold premium membership,"i have been attending puregym over a year now. when i first purchased my premium plus membership it was sold to me as 24/7 access, premium multi-vitamin water, free access to a body measurement machine and more. the gym has now got restricted hours, meaning it is much busier in the day. in addition to this, as a shift worker this is extremely inconvenient and restrictive to when i can attend the gym. 24 hour access was the main reason i join puregym. the multi-vitamin water is restricted to a certain volume every 20 minutes which is not suitable when doing an intense workout, especially now the normal water fountain has been out of order for weeks. another change has been the classes, fewer of them and not at all at varied times. this never used to be the case. finally, the modern body scanner has been replaced by a cheap one that looks like it belongs in a boots store, as well as requiring a £1 coin. considering my membership included this when i joined and now i am offered a lower quality version for £1, this is very disappointing. this is such a shame as the equipment and staff are fantastic! but i feel conned out of money when i am paying the same for a worse experience in multiple ways. *edit* thanks for the useless reply. castle marina is not a viable option early in the morning or late at night and the suggest of this shows lack of thought and consideration."
1,2023-01-28,Recently changed its 24 hour opening…,"recently changed its 24 hour opening times, it had nothing to do with the amount of usage that pure gym is using as an excuse for the change, the hours were because pure gym beeston did not want to pay the enhanced insurance for night usage.. in your pure gym contract it states the opening hours of the gym and pure gym changing the terms of this contract is a breach of contract.."
3,2023-01-28,Poor compared to other puregyms,"snowhill puregym is poor compared to other puregyms: * poor quality lockers, probably over 100 broken lockers that cant be locked, only a handful that do lock, prepare to waste your time finding a locker that does work. desperately need to upgrade lockers. * no dedicated isolated studio room so music and microphone voices from classes goes across gym floor in an obnoxious way. they didnt pay extra to create proper rooms for classes. * there are no dumbbells in functional area, no reebok steps, not enough 8kg, 12kg kettlebells (maybe like 1 of each, youll be lucky to find them). * downstairs weights area is dark, dingy and dumbbells are old and warn out. in need of new equipment and redecorating/renovation.  pros: upstairs cardio: lots of treadmills, cross-trainers, bikes, rowers.  like other puregyms it will have annoying radio: every 5 mins prepare to hear annoying drums, health/safety messages. bring headphones or youll surely suffer."
1,2023-01-28,Not having 24/7 access is nonsense,"not having 24/7 access is nonsense. the gym is now more crowded and you are always in a rush to get there cause doors apparently lock you out an hour earlier than the closing time. will be looking for another gym soon if they leave things like this.  edit: reply is non-sense, mine and other peoples gyms were open 24/7 they cut the hours to reduce energy costs."
3,2023-01-24,Unprofessional staff,decent gym and equipment. busy but to be expected at peak times. hugely put off by the male staff member in pt uniform groping and flirting with a client (girlfriend?) in front of everyone on the cardio machienes. dark haired man with a beer belly and arm tattoos. really unprofessional and has made me definitely not want to approach male pts at this gym for help.
5,2023-01-28,Whats not to Like!?,"really cant understand why people have rated this gym so poorly, its a gym, you go get fit or build muscles, its not a pub or nightclub! the staff are always friendly, i have spoken to them all, and theyre very accommodating. the gym is very clean, i go early morning and theres a cleaner and instructor wiping down the equipment.  if anything its other customers that dont respect a clean environment and dont sanitize the equipment after dripping sweat on the machines.  remember not everyone wants to make friends, its nice to be just left alone to do your thing, and leave, no fuss, just an enjoyable fitness session.  theres one lady, i dont know her name, but shes probably the most energetic and enthusiastic personal trainer ive ever seen, the blonde one with ponytail?? early - mid 20s maybe younger, she takes classes, and i noted that her bike class on a saturday is always packed out, 30+ people.  if youre looking for a gym thats low cost but includes everything you need, puregym colchester is the gym for you, ive used many gyms and this is probably one of the better ones in colchester."
1,2023-01-23,This puregym in Hammersmith have racist…,this puregym in hammersmith have racist manager if you are british in this gym you can do whatever you want move other person stuff and use their machine any thing you want he is on your side if you are not british it means you have to be quiet and do not say anything and rules in this gym means you can not do super sets because if someone sees your machine empty they can use it without saying anything i don’t know this is rules for all puregym or only here toilets are so so so dirty nobody cares
5,2023-01-27,Luca Palumbo PT - Pure Gym Hemel Hempstead,"luca palumbo, fantastic at getting his clients to enjoy training and achieve the results they want. i have been boxing and pt’ing with him for a while now and i can see the transformation. keep up the good work luca. 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾"
4,2023-01-27,"New Gym with good access, but why has it been closed through night three times this month","a clean gym (well its new so should be), and easy way to train with qr code access, but seems to be having teething problems with opening through night. i am a very early morning trainer and therefore like to arrive at 04:30 and earlier. their has been three occasions this month (including this morning), where the gym is closed and not opening till 06:00. emails are sent, although one email on the 25.1.23 was sent at 02:45 and i missed it as on road and was already at closed site. i have though found that users are respectable and friendly."
2,2023-01-26,Give us back 24/7!,wont bother with mentioning all faulty things in the gym but how about change of opening times back to advertised 24/7? or atleast do 6-22 even through weekends? going from being opened 24 hours to 12 hours over the weekends is just bad. gym is getting crazily overcrowded through days and its basically not possible to get to machines/benches without waiting. answering that gym was not being used that much through these hours is far beyond ridiculous as it doesnt require any member of the staff to be present through night hours as it has been before.. please consider why people are with you [24/7 is big part of it]...
4,2023-01-26,Puregym and my experience,"the gym has become a huge part of my life and puregym especially has been nothing less than outstanding in all aspects including the staff, the equipment and the overall atmosphere of the facility. i feel like the new manager, charlie, has been a great addition to the company as he is very attentive. likewise, the trainers endurance and richard have been a huge help and encouragement in and out of the gym.the only issue i would say is the new staff that has been recruited recently. i assume it might be the training or the people themselves, but the constant use of phones and lack of attention towards the customer has been very concerning and disheartening. i can only hope these actions are discouraged by senior members of staff. all in all, puregym still has my heart and always will."
4,2023-01-26,all i want us for this pure gym to be…,all i want us for this pure gym to be 24 hours😫😫 or at least open earlier (5am) it’s already nice but this would just make it perfect
1,2023-01-26,Gone from bad to worse..,"ive trained here for over a year and its gone from bad to worse. the move to not being 24/7 is shocking. i have an off-peak membership and i still pay the same as i did before but can only train between 8:30 - 10pm. the gym is now more over crowded than before, 120 people in the gym at 9pm at night and you struggle to find a free bench. half the lights in the gym are faulty, the place is dirty, equipment is broken or missing and the air con pumps out hot air. seems as if the company only care about making money and not about their members. ill be taking my money elsewhere. shocking business. dont even bother."
5,2023-01-26,Great Cycle Class!,"really friendly gym. particularly enjoying the cycle classes with pete, hes really motivational and adapts the class to accommodate all abilities"
5,2023-01-23,I love this gym,"i love this gym, the staff are lovely the manager did a pump class which is the best ive been to, and made it fun as well as really getting me sweating. i really recommend sam as a pt, shes been excellent. i love the atmosphere anyone can go of any experience and not feel out of place"
1,2023-01-26,No longer 24/7 - poor maintenance,"no longer 24/7 the staff is friendly but the machine, lights, cctv, and hot water are always broken. lately, they changed the opening hour from 24/7 to closed at 10 pm.   the gym is already busy enough and they choose to reduce the operations hours which will make it worst.  also, you cant cancel the membership from the website, the button wont work.  email them and they get back to me that i could cancel my direct debit.  this is very suspicious, imagining if they are showing the turnover/ retention report to the investor.  most of the members quitting reasons will be failed on payment, instead of poor management of the gym.   cause you wont be able to cancel it on the website provide a reason."
1,2023-01-25,Possum?!?!?!?,"there was a possum in the lockers, it was a bloody nightmare"
1,2023-01-23,This should be renamed as a Boxing Gym,i am a frequent user of this gym and over the last few months the training experience has become a joke because of a few easily solvable problems  1 - fighting - in the evening the studio are has become a fight club. there are large groups of young males who fight each other. sometimes they put on full boxing gear and spar and sometimes its just a full out fight. this is whilst onlookers sit around the edge spitting and vaping. as a female wanting to stretch in this area it is almost out of bounds as it is incredibly intimidating. this happens despite my understanding that there is no contact sport licence for this gym and it is not advertised as a boxing gym.  2 - sharing of codes - sometimes entering the gym is a nightmare because there are large groups of very young males (they look about 13-16) stood at the entrance texting each other their code to enter. surely you can check your system for when a single code is used multiple times in a couple of minutes and suspend it. 2 days ago one of the lads was literally shouting his code through the glass because his friends were stuck inside. i thought it was against pure gym policy to share codes.
1,2023-01-24,Such a terrible idea to move from 24hr opening times...,such a terrible idea to move away from 24 hour opening times! working out late at night worked perfectly for me. ill be cancelling my membership and moving elsewhere if this isnt changed. shame too as it was on my route home from work and it isnt a bad gym that others make out. im going to have to go out of my way to work out now...
5,2023-01-25,Love the gym,"love the gym, great friendly staff. the only thing missing is a hip thrust machine!"
1,2023-01-25,Left after one visit.,was a member of puregym for some time with no issues. i moved to colchester and went to the gym there. within minutes an angry manager pounced on me for carrying a small draw string bag. i tried to explain that i have things i need to use but he was too busy on a power/ego trip. the staff in here seem to have a really bad attitude towards members based just on the way the look. i terminated my membership immediately.
2,2023-01-25,Not enough equipment,"the gym was quite good when it opened but there was a lack of weight plates, even with few members. but now the gym is absolutely rammed with new members, there is not just a lack of plates but a complete lack of equipment in general. too many casual members that spend more time chatting, and too many young members that spend more time playing around than working out. thats all good and well, people are different, and that is exactly why a gym should have an array of different equipment and multiples of the same item, not just the bare minimum that taunton puregym offers. a shame because i used to go to various puregym centers around the country and this one is by far the most ill equipped."
5,2023-01-25,Great gym!,"love this gym, team are so friendly! comfortable exercising environment with no judgment…"
1,2023-01-24,Wish I could give a 0 star rating,"wish i could give a 0 star rating. changing the gym hours because they noticed ""low usage"" - ridiculous logic, the gym is only quiet from around 1am till about 5am. im moving to ""thegym"" group since they care more about their customers views. goodbye puregym!!"
1,2023-01-25,Terrible customer service,"terrible customer service! changed the gym opening times but only email customers that signed up for newsletters, surely a change this big you would want to inform all customers. they will fully neglected customers and have been dismissive to all complaints as you can see below.  suggesting that customers can just go to limehouse pure gym or east india is not good enough, most people, especially women, do not feel comfortable walking at late hours inadvertently putting people at risk.  as one of the most expensive pure gyms in london you would think that the facilitates would reflect this. clearly they are taking advantage of the location and upping the prices to match the bankers and such, cutting the hours to 6am - 10pm limits so many people there are numerous reviews stating that the gym has been busy during the night and there is no reason to change the hours. surely you should change the membership prices to reflect this.  utterly disappointed with the complete lack of communication of your staff and care for your customer."
1,2023-01-25,Functional area is non functional!!!,functional area has been non functional for over 2 months now and looks like a building site!! this means only 2/3rds of the gym is available to use causing long waits on equipment. there has been zero correspondance apart from a sign at the entry in november saying it would take 7 days to sort. can we get an update or a 1/3rd reduction in fees till sorted?
1,2023-01-25,Booked a class that got cancelled with…,booked a class that got cancelled with no notification. a text would have been appreciated.
4,2023-01-24,Fantastic spin with Peter motivational…,fantastic spin with peter motivational music and great coach.. followed by 45 min strength with harry ( works better than 30 mins) hes great and always pushes/encourages me top 2 hours thankyou
5,2023-01-24,Amazing PT experience with Luca!,"ive been working out with luca palumbo for 18 months now and ive seen amazing results!  luca made me feel comfortable instantly. hes super encouraging and knowledgeable and would highly recommend anyone thinking of picking up a pt or programme, to get in touch with luca!"
1,2023-01-23,This gym is a disgrace,"this gym is appalling. there are lights that have not been fixed for months. the hot water was missing for weeks. the hours have been cut which means i cannot now train on a saturday morning as it does not open until 8am and if it does not change (a manager said it was an experiment for a few weeks), i will leave for a gym that is open from 7am. there are about four or five managers in here who do not want to take responsibility for anything and pass the buck to another manager. the trainers seem demoralised by them when you talk to them. not just the problems i listed above, but there are people training that block lots of machines at the same time. if you ask the trainers they say that have spoken to the managers but they do nothing. the gym is meant to be for everyone, not everything in the gym for the select few. taking two of a squat rack, bench press and treadmill should not be allowed, but having all three and dumbbells at the same time stops others training. what is needed in here is one manager that the buck stops with. that manager can get things fixed and stop anyone who uses more than one thing at a time. they could walk round putting weights away while stopping people doing that"
1,2023-01-24,I don't usually leave reviews however…,"i dont usually leave reviews however this gym is massively dissapointing. the change of opening times (when puregyms are meant to be 24hr) was completely unnecessary and aggravating as usually i train late due to my schedule. the gym itself is more or less functional although there are ongoing issues with lighting, cctv, cleanliness and hot water. subsequently im looking into alternative gyms.."
3,2023-01-24,Don't go if you're fussy about hygiene,"its really handy being right in the city centre and you never have to wait for equipment even during busier periods. however, its hotter that hades, smells terrible and is pretty filthy throughout"
1,2023-01-24,Gym closes to early. Signed up to a 24/7 Gym,"love the gym, but totally disappointed with the change in opening hours. still trying to get complaint email to manager. no response from the generic feedback email addresses."
3,2023-01-22,Recently signed up ( also use other…,recently signed up ( also use other gyms in surrounding areas )  treadmills don’t work properly changing rooms are filthy ( never seen a cleaner in the building) and it’s might cold!
5,2023-01-24,I thoroughly enjoy training with Kamil,"i thoroughly enjoy training with kamil, not only am i happy with the results aesthetically, but i’m also stronger and a lot more confident. i look forward to continuing my journey and progress even further. i’d definitely recommend being coached by him!"
5,2023-01-24,Great gym and facilities,great gym and facilities. highly recommend luca palumbo as a pt with his help and guidance i have lost 15kg and i am able to do 6 consecutive pull ups which i never thought i would be able to do. he got me on a diet plan which doesn’t leave me feeling hungry. highly recommended.
3,2023-01-24,Classes are great,classes are great. however i feel the bidston moss gym hygiene is going down rapidly. ladies showers and changing rooms are disgusting filthy dirty. the studio for classes is equally as dirty.
1,2023-01-13,The showers in this Gym are appalling,the showers in this gym are appalling. you cannot regulate the temperature and you have to keep pressing a button every 30 seconds to get water. the great portland street gym is very depressing. no personnel present - i had to obtain assistance from the cleaner in the changing rooms. i paid £60 to puregym and have requested a refund the day after joining the club without any response from them! avoid this club like the plaque. update. puregym have refunded me. thank you.
1,2023-01-22,Would give you zero,would give you zero .  why on earth would u be  moving away from a 24 hour  a day gym to restricted hours .  this gym is already very busy and will only get worse due to the limited hours .  please change this back or lose a lot of your long serving members !
3,2023-01-23,Way too hot in the gym,"it is way too hot inside the gym, makes it feel like youre working out in a furnice. i started my workout in the upstairs studio where its perfectly nice and cool, great for when youre warmed up from your workout anyway. then i moved downstairs to use some machines and it genuinely felt hard to breathe from how hot it was. please try to keep the temperature a bit cooler, doesnt make sense to have it so warm where people are sweating from working out anyway."
1,2023-01-18,Leaky roof and no air con,never has the air con on and the roof leaks badly. also much more busy late now as brighton central closes at 10pm.
5,2023-01-22,Gym is great,"gym is great, but they need a hip thrust machine, can’t do hip thrusts when there’s a class on as there’s no space"
5,2023-01-23,5 million stars to kayley pt,"5 million stars to kayley pt. when our pump class got cancelled at the very last minute,  kayley stepped in to help instruct us so we didnt miss out on the opportunity,  even though she was only there to join in the class with us all. she made us work to our full potential. massive thankyou kayley, you absolute superstar !!!!."
5,2023-01-19,Happy with what pure gym Holborn has to offer,"lots of great equipment, very friendly and helpful staff was given a really in depth tour on 1st visit and this was my 2nd time in pure gym holborn and have not been disappointed, i have even referred friends of mine to use the gym, look forward to returning again soon :)"
1,2023-01-02,Please avoid this gym,"gym is now not 24/7 and theyre still charging the same price. the amount of issues the gym has had in the last few months is terrible. the lights have been broken for several weeks, the boiler broke for several months, the cctv broke for some time and my bike got stolen outside. one of the members of staff said hed contact me back regarding my stolen bike after management had taken a look at the cctv but no one contacted me. theres a new machine broken each week i go and having lights broken is a safety hazard, which could easily be fixed. this gym is poor in most areas now and i will be cancelling my membership as soon as possible. please avoid this gym."
1,2023-01-23,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!,"i am absolutely appalled by the state of this gym; the lights havent worked for the past month, the cctv isnt working, the ceiling leaks and the staff are rude and unhelpful, it is also very unsafe to have any possesions in this gym as my stuff got stolen from my locker the other week. it is no longer 24/7 which does not suit my life style and the price hasnt even decreased, i have since left this gym for the better and will be telling friends, family and collegues to avoid at all costs!!!!!"
3,2023-01-22,The funny thing about them taking away…,the funny thing about them taking away 24hr openings is that outside the gym it still says its open 24hr on posters on both sides of the entrance doors.
2,2023-01-21,Concerns,"the toilets are always out of order, there are 3 for all those people and all the wcs have been out of order for quite a long time. the number of lockers is not sufficient. there are frequent announcements about safe training and constant cctv observation. the other day there were a group of youngsters boxing in the studio and were risking other people and themselves but nobody from the pure gym team bothered to stop them."
5,2023-01-16,Good variety of early morning early…,"good variety of early morning early classes, nice clean gym always tidy. instructors are friendly and offer good advice and personal training."
1,2023-01-16,False advertising,"advertised as 24hrs so i signed up. 3 days later, receive an email saying they’re moving to limited opening (with no notice or discount in price!). feeling very ripped off.  edit: same response to every review, not addressing the false advertising. low usage at night?? it’s currently 20 mins until the new closing time and there are about 130 people in the gym according to the app."
5,2023-01-22,The classes are very good!The…,"the classes are very good!the instructors are fantastic :sam,charlotte,chris,toby, rory.there are plenty of options and i feel absolutely great after each class!highly recommended to everyone!!"
4,2023-01-22,Great as expected,"i am moving to canterbury so transferring my membership from another puregym. pretty much what i expected, good gym, spacious and a good range of kit - but tend to find what makes a puregym are the staff. from my brief tour with jodie and noting other staff interacting with customers i dont think i am going to be disappointed."
2,2023-01-20,Disgusting lack of standards of cleanliness,"the gym is large and so have up until now felt i can socially distance quite well. however the cleanliness is really poor since the ladies who used to work there have moved on. the toilets (shared gender) are repulsive all the time, even when theyve just been supposedly checked by the management on the rota. pubic hairs, urine and god knows what all over the bowl and seats. i dropped my water bottle on the floor and had to mop up with toilet tissue so the next person didnt slip and it came up black, i dont think the floors can ever have been mopped. the sanitising sprays have not been refreshed in months so unlikely will actually be useful when used to clean equipment and most of them have been empty completely since november. for someone who has an immune system problem these areas are very important and the gym managers just arent looking after customers (my review is not the only one mentioning cleanliness). to add to that the air smells stagnant and stale/ damp so although the air conditioning vents themselves are periodically cleaned the system needs a complete overhaul since were dealing with so many bugs and viruses this year. an absolute shame things have been left to slide this way, especially when vulnerable people like myself have found benefit of using. i think i will be cancelling my membership to be honest. fine if youre a gym goer who has no hygiene standards but otherwise youre best looking elsewhere."
3,2023-01-14,Class timetable not what it was.,"been coming here for years and have been happy up until recently. i was very disappointed to find they had dropped my favourite yoga class at very short notice due to budget cuts.  they dont inform you when they do this, they expect you to notice on the app, so it is easy to turn up looking forward to your class only to find it has been cancelled!  annoying!  it feels like the class timetable is being eroded."
5,2023-01-22,Great gym at low cost,"great gym, gets a little busy in the afternoon, but good early morning. fantastic equipment and facilities, especially considering the monthly price."
1,2023-01-21,Change to opening hours,"i’ve been a loyal puregym member for some years, and have always been an early bird (5am – 7am).  following the recent amendment to opening hours – i am now struggling to fit in my workout before work, and am finding the gym very busy (queues at the door at 6am)  this is extremely frustrating as we have been offered no financial discount, and the alternative arrangements made (castle marina) are not viable for most in terms of transport etc.  having supported the business throughout the pandemic, it feels like my loyalty was in vein, and is unappreciated.  i will be seeking an alternative as soon as possible."
1,2023-01-21,Not a great first impression,"recently signed up , not a great first impression 21.1.23 first time using it, tbh not a great first impression! weights / dumbbells everywhere can’t seem to find a pair of dumbbells everything is just everywhere. there was a massive sandwich board saying membership will be suspended if weights are not reracked it’s a pointless sign how do you police it?  i completely understand that it’s saturday night and unstaffed but surely at busy times staff are needed. i also understand i’m paying a low rate, for a very first impression wasn’t a good one space is very bland no colour long overdue a refit. and the amount of cardio equipment compared to free weights and resistance machine isn’t ideal. as such you find yourself waiting a while for a bench , resistance machine and now days more and more people are training with weights wether that be free weights or resistance machines , as such perfect for those who just do cardio. more lighting need outside entrance very dark especially with small step bit dangerous.  tbh considering cancelling as i do doubt any of this will be taken onboard or anyone will get in contact with myself."
2,2023-01-20,Not 24 hours! No notice to new members,"i joined this gym a week before they announced their new hours from being 24 hours and there was no mention of this before for new members. this is not what i paid for. despite closing at 10pm they did not edit the off peak times members can go to the gym, so instead of having 8:30pm till midnight , its just 1 hour 30mins which is ridiculous and restrictive when the gym is busy towards the closing time so theres not always time to use the machines!"
5,2023-01-20,Great gym,the gym is great. lots of equipment and everything is very clean.
1,2023-01-21,Poor gym,"gym below expectations, no punching bag, slow app, couldnt get to the locker room at night to get my clothes after training, front door doesnt work properly, lots of kids sitting on phones occupying exercise machines. the big downside is the locker room and showers, the inability to unsubscribe from the app"
1,2023-01-19,No longer 24/7,"changed opening hours no longer 24/7, not able to go anymore at sensible times that fit my shift pattern and the alternative gym isnt in walking distance."
5,2023-01-21,Fantastic Spin and Body Pump class with…,fantastic spin and body pump class with ellie - she’s the best!
5,2023-01-02,Recently signed up for the new year and…,"recently signed up for the new year and very happy. does what it says on the tin! nice equipment, nice staff"
2,2023-01-20,Dirty entrace to males showers,"dirty entrace to males showers! the floor leading to the showers in the mens changing rooms is dirty and muddy. it hasnt been cleaned since the showers were reopened on november 27th 2022. it is so unhygienic and i dont understand why it hasnt been mopped in over 2 months.  the gym has now reduced opening hours, so for those of us who liked an early morning workout on the weekends, this is now not possible. so disheartening what is happening with this gym."
5,2023-01-20,Great gym,"just started with them this week and i must say i am impressed. parking is free as the gym is inside the shopping center. access is easy (24/7), just scan the qr code from the app and the doors open. plenty of lockers available. lots of equipement to work with from gym (stability) balls to trx sets and push sleds, lots of weights and machines, treadmills and everything you can think of they have it. staff is always in sight, my wife needed help with booking a fitness class on their app and the manager sorted it. it can be a bit busy in the evenings but from my (little) experience with gyms i think it will cool down after january, funny that showers are never busy. subscription was 3x cheaper than other gyms and there is no contract so no 6 month in advance payment. 5 stars no doubt."
1,2023-01-20,Absolutely useless,absolutely useless. they dont read emails or are to stupid to understand what there saying.
3,2023-01-20,Been a fan of Puregym since I've been…,"been a fan of puregym since ive been going to the lichfield branch. i usto enjoy the nice cool temperature in the gym however recently this has changed and the gym is no longer cool enough to train in. the temperature is now on the warmer side, i have mentioned this to the management team and been told nothing can be done about it as there is a new puregym policy on temperature that comes from head office. i am aware of other complaints made about the temperature, other gym goers find it too warm,  please can this be looked at, puregym is a good gym it would be a shame for this to let it down."
2,2023-01-20,Best equipment removed,"used to have really good equipment, most of which was removed over the christmas/new year period. now there is only 1 chest press machine, no seated leg curl, 2 leg presses. overall not an awful gym, nice staff, clean, just now had a lot of the best machines removed and not replaced with like-for-like. the new machines also seem to be of lower quality. understand the need to standardise machinery but unfortunate. do now have more cables which is helpful."
2,2023-01-20,At Bletchley the showers fluctuate…,at bletchley the showers fluctuate between very hot to stone cold. also i understand you like to play music but why so loud when virtually everyone wears their own headphones and the gym is nearly empty!!!!
1,2023-01-19,Appalling.,appalling.. not fix for purpose!  firstly i have sent 3 emails to the pure gym manager at palmers green & had no response about the poor wi-fi!  there is currently 2 toilets out of order. the back machine has not worked since the pure gym opened.  leg push machines squeaks.  poor air conditioning.  basically don’t join the palmers green pure gym.. head to southgate or find an alternative gym.
5,2023-01-19,Great gym,"great gym, friendly atmosphere, caring and helpful staff.   i only attend classes, they are really great and productive. thank you for adding a variety with lots of classes available at different times and a massive thank you to all the instructors for your time and support. keep pushing ""us""... 5 stars for you."
5,2023-01-19,Signed up for so personal training…,signed up for so personal training sessions with max cooper. he made me so comfortable in the gym and taught me how to use everything properly really pushed me and showed me what i can achieve. strongly recommend
2,2023-01-17,Youth centre for bored young boys,"the gym is crowded in the evenings with young boys who have nowhere else to go so they just bum around in the gym chatting. the changing room has groups of boys vaping, using their camera phones and checking out all the naked old men getting changed."
5,2023-01-19,Personal trainer - Lina,i’ve been coming to train with lina for the past 2 weeks. shes super approachable and motivating. i always look forward to our sessions and definitely plan on training with her over the long term.
5,2023-01-19,My experience is very good,"my experience is very good, because the environment in the gym makes me feel comfortable, and pt also has very professional knowledge. when you are not sure whether you are doing the right movements, they will guide you in time."
3,2023-01-18,NEED MORE WEIGHTS,usually the gym is good apart from recent problems with the toilets/changing rooms and the fact that i cant find weights in there to save my life. i dont know if someone has been stealing them but they need some more 20kg plates in there asap.
3,2023-01-17,Smells really bad in there,smells really bad in there. broken equipment and missing equipment now its been segregated. needs sorting asap
5,2023-01-19,I’ve trained with Lina for the last…,"i’ve trained with lina for the last year, the girls amazing ! always makes the sessions challenging and fun at the same time. highly recommend! great gym overall :)"
5,2023-01-19,Lina - coach trainer,"i have been looking for the right personal trainer for a long time, but i finally found it!  after the first meeting, i knew that lina was a good choice.  she has amazing knowledge and experience, she is professional but at the same time very understanding and caring.  i had never exercised before and thanks to it i overcame my weaknesses."
2,2023-01-18,No consistency,"for the last few months the classes we normally do keep being changed or cancelled, they can’t retain any staff as they keep leaving. 6 months ago we were doing 6 classes a week, as from next week that will be down to 2 classes due to another staff member leaving. there are other classes available but i don’t want to do legs bums and tums as i like circuit based classes. it appears despite a number of complaints by members pure gum don’t care. quite a few people have left and i will give it a couple of months and i will probably leave if it doesn’t improve. pure gym need to ask themselves why their staff keep leaving."
1,2023-01-19,Unfriendly unresponsive people,unfriendly unresponsive people!  crowded with people in the hall!  too many people in the gym!  bad atmosphere!
1,2023-01-19,Join a different gym,"i recently put my gym membership on hold due to a back injury yet they still tried to take money out of my girlfriend’s account (she took out a joint membership for us) and then suspended my membership due to ‘being in debt’ for the next months payment (which was a suspended month that i never attended), then they added ‘admin fees’ and ‘re-submission’ fees to crank ‘the debt’ even higher as a form of intimidation. there is absolutely no way of contacting them by phone as they are ‘purely an online gym’. i have no way of going inside to talk to someone because you cannot even enter the gym without scanning your app (as you have to enter through pods that always stink). inside the gym it is overly corporate, overly woke and always packed to the brim inside. i have been a customer for nearly 9 years, but now they have left me no choice but to cancel my membership because i am not paying nearly £50 for a month i never attended due to an injury."
1,2023-01-18,Not 24/7 sad times,normally good gyms but changed the times from 24hour to 6-10 which doesn’t suit my life style with work and stuff thought the whole point and appeal of pure gym was 24/7
4,2023-01-19,Kamarl is amazing,"kamarl is amazing! his pump classes are great and full of energy. also, yoga and pilates are really good. areas to improve should be guidance to how to use the machines, i booked a get started session long time ago and i didnt receive any support"
1,2023-01-18,Unacceptable corporate robbery,"this is the blanket response from puregym regarding the recent (shockingly dumb) decision to limit the opening hours:  ""we would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. due to noticing lower gym usage at night, we have made the decision to close the gym between certain hours. members of this gym however will be able to access london limehouse.""  this is a complete lie - i have never seen such a busy gym between 9pm and 1am ever - its honestly so popular! im staggered that they have done this and anything other than an immediate reversal of this decision will result in me leaving.  i really hope they make the right choice."
1,2023-01-17,The gym was advertising as a 24h gym…,the gym was advertising as a 24h gym but they’ve changed so now it’s closing at 10pm. i can workout late evenings.
5,2023-01-18,This gym is just what I needed!,"after trying out most of the gyms in the area, i can hands down say this is the best one! it’s exactly what i needed, something affordable, with lots of great classes, friendly and helpful staff, lots of different equipment. it’s always clean as well and the hairdryers are a great added bonus! i hope all the current members of staff are here to stay for good as they are all fabulous! the classes with them are the best i’ve ever had in county durham!"
1,2023-01-18,No longer 24/7 but no reason given,now no longer 24/7 but no reason given. just a ‘thanks for your understanding’ despite not explaining the reason. it now means the gym is ridiculously busy and those with early/late working hours cannot use it.
1,2023-01-18,they have a very poor website and no…,they have a very poor website and no help canter. i cannot upgrade or downgrade my membership from my profile.
1,2023-01-16,Impossible to train now as from 6pm,"impossible to train now as from 6pm it is sooooooo busy until close at 10:00pm. watching the app i went at 9pm as late as i could, hoping it would be quieter. but there was still 115 people in! so hard to train. also, from 9:30pm you start to get chased out like rats. limehouse is not convenient, hence why i signed up to canary wharf. last week, i checked how busy the gym was when i left at 10:30pm during the week (before you started closing early) and you still had 40 people inside!! 40! the hours you have picked make no sense and does not work. maybe there is no one in at 3am, but look at the data from 10-11pm. there is more than enough people inside to warrant keeping it open. too hard now, i am cancelling my membership."
2,2023-01-18,Am not liking the new times it's making…,am not liking the new times its making the gym really busy at times and you have to wait to long to use equipment. before this the gym was fine. soon as i find another gym i will leave
5,2023-01-16,No complaints at all,no complaints at all. could not get better value for money elsewhere.
5,2023-01-17,I have been a member since they opened…,"i have been a member since they opened the gym! the management has improved the gym by adding new equipment and keeping the place tidy and clean! the only cons is about people that do not wash their clothes after a workout, making other people work out almost unbearable!!!"
1,2023-01-18,Disappointed about the new opening hours…,"disappointed about the new opening hours, but appreciate not many like a 5am workout.  now, the infuriating thing is that they advertise the base memberships at £27.99 but charge me £37.99!!!!!  i’ve been a member since 2016 but probably not for much longer."
5,2023-01-16,Great gym,great gym! clean and lovely staff.
1,2023-01-17,Really angry and disappointed that you…,really angry and disappointed that you haven’t mentioned on your website when joining that the opening hours changed from 24/7 to certain opening time.  this is what i call a daylight robbery!!!  cancelling my membership now as i can only attend after 10pm.
5,2023-01-17,Good gym,the newry gym is the best and james the pt should get. award g for his good work and how he help people in the gym the best pt in the gym
1,2023-01-17,"same price, changed opening hours from 24/7 to 6am-10pm, not even worth it","they brag themselves with ""most gyms are open 24/7"" when they just changed opening hours of this one. i used to come after 9pm as it is very crowded before that because its serving the entire canary wharf. and they have the cheek to continue charging the most even after changing the opening hours. its not like keeping lights on costs that much. they could have easily implemented peak/offpeak passes. i can pay the same price for an actually decent gym with the same opening hours, the only advantage for this was it being 24/7"
1,2023-01-17,Parking situation is a joke,"parking situation is a joke, not clear that you have to input your registration to get free parking. now facing multiple fines of £60 a pop, only just joined in jan, but now looking to cancel if thats what happens. small signs may cover you legally, but it needs to be made ultra clear when you come in, which it most definitely is not."
5,2023-01-13,I’ve recently finished having PT…,"i’ve recently finished having pt sessions with monika. i had 20 in total and really enjoyed every session. monika was a great pt, pushing me each session to hit new pb’s and tailoring every work out. she was super accommodating if i needed to change the session and worked round my schedule. highly recommend her to anyone looking to start the gym and become their best selves!"
1,2023-01-17,SAVEHALF,"got a promo code for membership pure gym rejects my code but states i will be able to use it at the final payment stage of the application. surprise, surprise you cannot use it at the payment stage - you have to pay the full amount."
1,2023-01-13,You can't charge £40 for this?!,"im so disappointed in the move from being 24 hours to only opening from 6am to 10pm on a weekday. this now means im unable to use the gym! even more angry that money was taken out of my account for membership this month before i was informed of the change. in fact, i was only informed of the change 4 days before it happened. really poor form pure gym."
1,2023-01-16,"Avoid, waste of time","went in, saw the lines to all equipments, went straight out. dont limit the hours if you dont have the capacity to accomodate people whose hours you cut.  spare me the cheeky marketing bull on popularity, if you cant handle running a proper gym without queues do to your stupid decisions leave the place and let someone else run it. and if your so damn popular how comes you cant afford to pay light and heating during night so you gotta cut hours genius? change your slogan, ""puregym -most popular broke business in uk"", that would he a good laugh.  whole sit is ur own doing now, gym was fine before, did you appoint liz truss as your ceo or what happened???"
5,2023-01-16,Had a really good LBT session.,had a really good lbt session. quite challenging but thoroughly enjoyed it.
3,2023-01-06,THE SMELL!!,"the smell!!! for goodness sake, sometimes i walk in the gym and want to throw up. it takes a while to get used to disgusting smell of 7-days-sweating bodies without a shower. this is not due to the gym goers, it’s just either very poor flow of air or serious cleaning issues. i’ve been to many other gyms, this is not normal!"
1,2023-01-16,puregum = pure disapointment,"wildly disapointed with the change from being 24 hours to opening at 6am. the sole reason i signed up was for flexability. very disapointed. the gym it self has a nice amount of equipment, but i avoid peak times. make of that what you will ."
4,2023-01-16,A really friendly gym,love this gym for the people.  the trainers are amazing (special shout outs to pete and chris).  friendly regulars and very sociable environment.  classes are great (although please could we have a conditioning class back in the early mornings - its all cardio!).  some of the equipment needs an upgrade......
1,2023-01-16,I am trying to use my Vitality with Pure Gym and it is impossible!,"i am trying to use my vitality with pure gym for a while. they have the information on the website but it does not say anything. it is super difficult to contact them since most of the channels are operated by bots. i have tried facebook, e-mail, etc. it is just impossible to have customer service. if you are planing to enrol do that knowing everything is automatic and there is no human contact for anything. so, if you have a problem, give up. there is no way to solve it. the installations are reasonable though. if you live nearby and there is no other option like me, then yes."
1,2023-01-16,One of the most expensive Pure gyms and…,one of the most expensive pure gyms and it is closing at 10pm on a weekday? at least make it 12 on a weekday and 10 on the weekend. are we not in london?
2,2023-01-15,Gym is freezing,"gym is freezing , tv’s turned off my staff while training, music turned down low or off, why? pt’s /staff are not bothered that people don’t clean down their equipment."
1,2023-01-16,What's going on,"changing room all closed again, showers all closed. 1 accessibility shower only and 1toilet working for the whole gym. nowhere to get changed. multiple machines broken, half the running machines turned off. no notice in the gym to say when changing room and showers will be back in use."
5,2023-01-14,"A great, affordable gym",loads of classes on which mean i can nip out for a lunch class and back with little disruption to work. everyone i’ve done a class with has been lovely. steve’s spin class was great.
3,2023-01-12,Nice gym & staff,"nice gym & staff, class timings not great some classes just 30 mins when same class 45. and frequency of classes erratic. spin classes would be great as classes on offer all very similar. i hope this improves as i only do classes so won’t continue with membership if no improvements this year. either increase timings so people can do back to back classes or make them longer so it’s worth while fighting the traffic to get there! more good classes during day please."
3,2023-01-14,Misplaced advertising 24x7 gym as their…,"misplaced advertising 24x7 gym as their most of the branch is not 24x7, i live in putney heath and putney and east sheen gym which are closet cooli to me is not 24x7. and also east sheen toilet seems to be broken all times and same goes for putney gym. i continue to use is puregym only for location. i really get annoyed on weekend as opening time is from 9am to 8pm which really i cannot go because of my work timings. anyways i am ranting with frustration.   just to add ""as headline its 24 hours, in advertising it 24 hours"" when you go to specific gym page relevant it shows hours. :) for me its like ""i advertise which suits me"" please read gym specific times. also i would like a question how many gyms you have and how many are 24 hours, if it more that 50% then probably its acceptable to advertise as 24 hours gym, just google ""pure gym"" and see the headline"
5,2023-01-12,Great gym,"great gym, the free weight area is massive and highly recommend. team are lovely as well. for the price you really cannot complain. did the free 3 day pass and joining tomorrow."
5,2023-01-13,Great experience at the gym,"great experience at the gym, luke & ruth the managers were very helpful with my pin isssue. loved the cycle class, this was one of the reasons why i joined. highly recommend coming to the gym here for only £17.99 per month."
1,2023-01-08,Join at your own risk. Paid and not able to use gym,"i joined pure gym in bournemouth the triangle, only to attend the classes the 8/1, today the 15/1 i still cant use it. when download the app it would show that i had my membership cancelled in mallard rd and would not let me do anything. payment was done and d. debit set. i called them but they dont have customer service on the phone! even their phone number appears everywhere. contacted them on twitter where a bot answers and ask pin code. 7 hours later someone answers that they ""helped me"" transferring my membership to mallard rd!! exactly the opposite i was asking, so inconvenient and far away and more expensive and they ""will charge the difference next month""! i told them that was wrong but never had an answer. i guess i will just have to cancel and ask for a refund as was not able to attend because of their own mistakes, if they dont refund me i will take the matter further. join a gym without customer service and dysfunctional app at your own risk."
2,2023-01-14,I was very disappointed in my first…,"i was very disappointed in my first visit the equipment is very minimal and of cheap standard there wasn’t many plates at all so you have to go on the hunt and take it off other machines, there is very few machines so you have to wait for someone to finish on alot of them, the mens urinals had a very strong smell of pee and didn’t seem like it’s been cleaned from one week to the next, and is hot for a gym so good knows what it’s like in the summer. i doubt i’ll even last a month here"
3,2023-01-14,Cold temperature within gym,"unfortunately i couldn’t see any staff when i visited today to ask if the gym temperature could be increased, as it felt below optimal temperature. possibly a consequence of the front outer door continuing to be wedged open with 2 weights. either way, it was really cold again. hopefully this will be rectified soon as it’s been like this since last year."
4,2023-01-14,Brilliant gym upgrade,the gym has undergone a refurb. the new layout and additional equipment have really improved the functionality of the huge space. even during busy periods it’s possible to access equipment whereas previously you’d have to queue. the women’s only area feels complete and has been extended. looking forward to the showers and changing rooms upgrade.
5,2023-01-13,"First time, Positive.","went for the first time today, first entering i was slightly worried, but with easy to follow directions and very helpful staff i felt like i fit in right away, i booked myself onto the induction, which contained a tour of the gym, the app, and how to find personal trainers, also if anyone wanted advice or a demonstration it was given to a high standard. after that i went around the gym on my own, spending some time in the quiet areas and the more public areas, after this a personal trainer started talking to me and he walked through deadlifting techniques and safety.  this gym from day one has made me feel like a respected member, and i cant help but recommend it."
4,2023-01-13,Can you please explain to me why you…,can you please explain to me why you are more expansive than all the other gyms and why if i join another i cant come to yours?
1,2023-01-13,Shocking maintenance,i’ve been a member of this gym for years and even continued with my membership through covid in order to support. its location makes it very convenient but the maintenance of this gym is disgraceful. i’ve lost count of the amount of times i’ve seen nuts and bolt’s literally fall off machines and the water fountain has been out of action for over a week! can’t help but wonder if the maintenance would have been quicker if it had been required for a paid drinks machine? really poorly managed gym
2,2023-01-11,Pure Gym Woolwich,pure gym woolwich been with them 3 months.just getting worse with time.gym is not open 24/7. they don’t offer much classes anymore. the few they have are always fully booked or cancelled. some equipment don’t work.
5,2023-01-13,Fantastic experience,"so far i have had a brilliant experience at pure gym. i frequently attend the classes and have noticed my fitness has improved since doing so. trainer amber has been really welcoming, and is always happy to help and support me with my fitness journey. i recently attended joes metcon class too which was really good."
1,2023-01-13,So after writing my review In December…,"so after writing my review in december one of my businesses linked to this trust pilot account has had spam reviews of my services despite not trading for over 12 months which is very suspicious, one review says im first to complain when this is the only company linked to a negative review? im sure you can make your own mind up on this. you will notice how theres an influx of reviews after receiving a negative review. think about what your reading, dont be naive these people are good at covering up and have tried to tarnish my reputation out of spite. if you wish me to delete this review then i would suggest getting the reviews on my dormant company taken off."
4,2023-01-13,I love coming to this gym,"i love coming to this gym, i tend to come in the mornings & i really enjoy the classes! the only comment i will make is i did the sweat 30 class and the instructor squeezed 4 rounds into half an hour. im grateful to get a lot out for the session however, i feel it would be better to leave at least 2/3 mins at the end of class to cool down. i cant stay after class as i have to get to work so i find im walking back into the cold weather without a cool down... other than that, really love it! :)"
5,2023-01-12,Excellent gym,"excellent gym, clean, plenty of equipement professional very welcoming especially from tony always there if i need help superb gym im here every morning for an hour and every evening plenty of machines to use"
3,2023-01-10,Can’t believe its the peak month and…,"can’t believe its the peak month and there are only 2 fully working cable machines.  why is it that it takes ages to fix something and when it eventually gets addressed it breaks again quickly.  the leg extension machine took many months to address.  limited equipment as it is in this gym and then you have regular breakdowns.  many people are getting fed up and you will end up losing customers.  would be good if the place invested in a cable rows machine too.  ——  update: appreciate the response, but actions speak louder than words. the staff are equally as disappointed because it’s out of their control too.  it’s not a new thing. has been consistently ongoing for a few years now. feedback definitely doesn’t get taken onboard. and lastly the gym is open 24 hours but not manned for that time. so someone like me has no one to ever talk to during my workout sessions."
4,2023-01-12,Very good price compared to other gyms…,very good price compared to other gyms around.
4,2023-01-12,Great gym,"great gym, plenty of equipment and the staff are all very friendly. only once have i been to the shower area and found it dirty but that’s more about members not tidying up after themselves.  my only gripe is there is no wifi and not great mobile signal so i often have trouble getting in the doors with the scanner. also would be useful when trying to use fitness apps to follow plans.  would be 5 stars if it wasn’t for the wifi."
5,2023-01-12,Staff are amazing and  it has a nice…,"staff are amazing and  it has a nice feel , good value for a gym, interested to see what new equipment they will purchase this year maybe some music on too.  gg"
3,2023-01-10,"Decent gym, but foul changing room",decent gym and decent value but gents changing room looks and smells foul. literally made my eyes water.
5,2023-01-11,Staff are friendly and very supportive…,staff are friendly and very supportive to old users get to the right equipment.
1,2023-01-12,Great gym,"great gym, bin comin ere years, 1 problem, yanga juice machine always out of order, ya pay for it each month and its never working, i dont bring juice, i rely on that 😕 last few sessions it aint bin working"
2,2022-12-17,"Machines, lockers, drink dispenser all broken","i was at this gym for a month and wont be back again. there are machines broken that are not getting fixed. the drinks machine that you pay extra for only works half of the time, when i mentioned this to the staff they just said, ""yeah its temperamental"", not a professional response at all!  half of the lockers in the mens changing room are broken, i keep a screwdriver in my bag and had to fix one myself, it took about 15 seconds!! if i can fix one that quickly it really makes you wonder why they havent fixed them yet.  trying to cancel my membership online is a hell of a chore, it keeps sending me through loops, will have to call them.  overall, i really dont recommend this gym."
3,2023-01-10,no longer 24 hours,extremely disappointed to hear that gym wont be 24 hours anymore. ive been going to the gym late at night (10-12) for the past few years and this will now disrupt my daily routine as i cant go to castle marina. it would have been smarter to close past 1am as ive seen a decent amount of people go at the same time i do.
5,2023-01-12,The overall cleanliness of the gym is…,"the overall cleanliness of the gym is spot on! can come and get your workout done without any hassle. the cleaner, tony is very friendly and chatty makes the experience more relaxing always got a smile on everytime i see him around the gym."
1,2023-01-11,Turned up for first time at puregym in…,"turned up for first time at puregym in glossop and sign said ""maximum parking 10 minutes between 2001hrs and 0759. what a waste of time for a 24hr gym. gym not entered and puregym membership cancelled."
3,2023-01-11,"Good gym, but needs maintenance","the atmosphere is lovely, but quite a few of the machines are broken or unusable in the last couple of weeks. also, opening hours have changed but there has been no change to the fee we are paying."

5,2023-01-11,Great gym in the portfolio,this is about puregym bedford heights.  baring in mind this is one of the ‘cheaper’ puregyms it is one of the best i’ve been to!!  lots of equipment (which is tidy and organised well (including the free weights which is a nice surprise)). lots of space and we’ll laid out.one of the cleanest puregyms i have been too.  had to speak to the manager as friends pin was not working and they are very knowledgable and friendly which was nice; saying ‘welcome’ when i said i had just transferred my home gym here (was katarina i spoke to).
2,2023-01-10,Telford - Smelly toilets and showers,telford - it stinks in the ladies toilets and showers every time i’ve visited the gym. it’s a really unpleasant smell and worries me about using those facilities. what risk am i taking with my health? one thing you can catch in public showers is legionnaires disease!
1,2023-01-11,Very bad and difficult to get in…,very bad and difficult to get in contact with someone. i am going to cancel this.
2,2023-01-10,Paying more for less???,gym’s good and staff are sound but advertising it as 24 hours when it’s not anymore (with no real reason given) but it’s the same price is well out. it’s already more expensive than most london gyms and now it’s open less than them? wha?
1,2023-01-10,Horrible,extremely dirty. especially the bathrooms are just shocking. be prepared to occasionally go hunting for weights as no one puts them back (even some of the pts don’t seem to do so). cables are always broken and takes months to repair. gets really busy and there is no phone service. do you actually want to join?
1,2023-01-10,PureGym Canary Wharf are cheats!,puregym canary wharf has reduced the hours open by 35% and still are charging me the same fee!  puregym are cheats!
3,2023-01-08,I struggled to get inside the building…,i struggled to get inside the building as the area where you need to key in your code is very dark at night when the gym is unstaffed. once inside the constant beeping noise from the smoke detector at the foot of the stairs is very distracting & annoying. this has been going off for my last couple of visits.
4,2023-01-09,Good,"clean, relaxed and respectful environment, clear gym messages on the screen."

5,2023-01-09,Great gym (Taunton) and personal trainer,"i hadn’t been to a gym in over 15 years and decided to join (taunton) when they had their opening offer and sign up to a pt (sam ryan).  i was incredibly nervous but 9 weeks on and i can say that it’s been a great experience.  the is gym spacious, well equipped and easy to use (with instructions for those who are unfamiliar) and i’ve not had to wait to use any of it.  i have the freedom to go when i like with 24/7 access which is great.  my pt sessions with sam have been brilliant and has been worth the investment.  she pushes me in every session but is incredibly encouraging (without being a drill sergeant!) and i’ve noticed a huge improvement in my overall fitness, strength and confidence.  i highly recommend her.as a fairly new gym go-er, i think it’s a really good gym."
5,2023-01-09,Brilliant gym!,"i have been a member of this gym now for 2 years, and it is proving to be one of the best decisions i ever made. i have a brilliant pt, and all the other staff/trainers are superb, everyone is very kind, friendly and supportive. excellent variety of classes, i have my favourites. ^  ^ i’ve accessed this gym at a variety of different times during the years, and have never left unsatisfied. i’m very happy with equipment and cleanliness of this gym, am definitely giving 5 stars!"
3,2023-01-09,Why are the morning classes now 30mins?!,"just returned from my first spin (cycle) class before christmas. it was a great class, and the instructor was very informative, but why are the morning classes now 30mins instead of 45mins?! 30mins is not long enough for a decent class. as soon as youve properly warmed up, there is only enough time for a couple of songs before the class is over. bring back the 45mins classes!!"
2,2022-12-24,Claim to be 24/7 yet they close without warning,"signed up for a 3-day pass on the 23rd december to try the place out: seemed ok apart from some broken equipment like a rowing machine.  turned up the next day to find a paper note on the outside of a bi-fold door (which was only visible when the place was closed) stating it was shut after midday, would not be open christmas day and iirc closed on boxing day and new years eve/day.  not only a waste of most of my pass, journey time and fuel but there was no warning about this when i signed up, nor did their phone app mention anything about this.  total incompetence on their part and no sure whether i will bother with a full membership if this is how customers are treated."
5,2023-01-08,PureGym is amazing,"puregym is amazing. it’s such a shame about the parking. spaces have been limited due to ongoing building work (since august 2022). i really thought that these spaces would be made available for the  christmas shoppers but to no avail. i struggled to get parked from november onwards. now that the gym is busy, the parking. is still poor. the building work has not subsided and there is no consideration for the existing customers of the retail park. very poor parking."
1,2023-01-08,Worse by the day,"did you get some brand new investors or something? higher prices but sloppier service.  something needs to change because puregym is spiralling, and fast.   say goodbye to your reputation.  you became popular for a reason so if it aint broke why fix it.  sad to see what puregym has become.  greed."
2,2023-01-08,Morning classes should be 7frpm 7am not…,morning classes should be 7frpm 7am not 630 which is too early. bring the spin classes back.
3,2023-01-08,Ladies areas,i am writing about the ladies only space in the gym.  i understand that some of us would not feel confortable training among the opposite sex. i myself am one of them that dont feel that confortable. the decision of not allowing male staff members going in that area has impacted us in two ways. first of all it comes across to us that puregym does not trust their own employees. that staff members are not securely checked when they are employed. and secondly i have been training with a male personal trainer for almost two years and i have been forced to train in the main area when it is packed and it makes me feel very uncomfortable.  i have spoken to the assistant manager long ago and he did not come back to me with any solution.
4,2023-01-04,Recently joined as a gym newbie and…,recently joined as a gym newbie and have been impressed with the staff who have been extremely helpful. the aircon works fine and despite others experience there is no smell and no overcrowding. i would definitely recommend that you try it for yourself.
4,2023-01-08,"Gym is good, but could do with more","gym is good, sometimes some equipment is damaged and takes a few weeks to get repaired but they do. issue i have is the lack of different equipment, no t-bar row, very few plated machines (shoulder press and incline press down stairs) and too many cardio machines. hardly see anyone use the crosstrainers upstairs, these should be replaced with different weightlifting equipment. other than that a good gym."
5,2023-01-07,Loved Hannah's combat class today,loved hannahs combat class today. gave me an all over body workout and cant wait for the next one. just love this gym in general and the staff are alsways very friendly.
1,2023-01-07,Bring back hip thrusts,"before the revamp, (sept/oct) you could find any number of girls and women at the back of the free weights doing barbell hip thrusts, all happy and content to set this up themselves. now following the revamp, there is no space to set them up but rather a thrust machine. i gave this machine a chance, but when i tried to stop my set i couldn’t get the weight and bar to lock which made me uncomfortable knowing i couldn’t stop a set whenever i began to struggle and wouldn’t be able to go to failure as i would have to lock the machine for a final raise. hip thrusts are a super simple exercise, so so basic and i don’t want to use a machine for them. simple as. i dont see the preacher curl stations being removed and forcing members to use the machine, the option is there. it’s so unfair to all of the paying members who want to set up, track the weight, and opt out safely of this exercise which often is performed with 80kg+ therefore the option to safely opt out is so important. i noticed another member move a box downstairs on the 6th of jan and set up the barbell and perform them the way she’s used to, then on the 7th i entered the gym and two big chest machines had been placed there, obviously to ensure there was no space for this practice to continue further. all i can say that is puregym is completely ignoring the wants and habits of its members. people are paying to go here and what you are offering as an alternative to thrusts simply isn’t good enough! you also say to go upstairs there’s a thrust area there- there’s a bench. with no barbell, no weights, just some weighted sacks, no one wants to use them. do you expect us to carry 6 plates and a barbell upstairs to use it instead?  i don’t know why this gym is being so adamant and stubborn about refusing to let people do thrusts which are a basic yet popular movement in a way that feels comfortable to them. why does it matter to you that much that you’d go out of your way to move equipment so people literally don’t have the space at all.  this is such a shame because i had noticed such an influx of girls doing them and i had hit so many pbs because the gym was so comfortable and well laid out but clearly you just see it as an inconvenience  additionally, the weights 1-10kg have been placed in the studio, i don’t think you realise this but this actually does isolate girls from feeling welcome in the gym, i just want to grab 7s to use with step ups on the box and now they’re in the studio which often has classes on.  all i can say is that i’m actually so disappointed you can see members habits and choose to completely isolate a group for the sake of what, either put some barbells and weights upstairs so girls can hip thrust, or keep boxes and some wall space free downstairs. there has to be a solution, we are the paying customers here and you’re making it feel like our workout is inconvenient.  i know i’m not the only one who feels this way as i’ve overheard the manager be asked what’s happened and he’s stupidly choosing to back up the layout decision. surely if people are bringing down boxes you can see that the layout is the problem, not the workout. i hope to see a solution very soon."
5,2023-01-07,There are weights I pick them up,there are weights i pick them up. i put them i repeat the cycle.
3,2023-01-07,With the Flu and Covid numbers going…,"with the flu and covid numbers going up, i am quite vigilant about cleaning equiment after use..however there never seem to be any spray bottles in the weights area or the studios..each area used to have 2 bottles each but now you are hard pressed to find one bottle. please can this be rectified especially as gym numbers tend to go up on january."
3,2023-01-04,NEED MORE PLATES!!,"the good: facilities are generally clean, people are generally pleasant and help each other out if needed, i would say this gym is aimed at beginners.  the bad: not the best for more long-term lifters. although it may seem like theres a lot of equipment e.g. dumbbells and plates in the free weight side, there just really isnt. if youve got a few people on the benches and a couple in the squat racks, then youve got no chance at getting the weights you want. you may be able to get a bar, but youll be building it up with random 2.5kgs you can find on the floor! even if you time it on the app so theres around 70-80 people in the gym, youll still struggle to find equipment free. imagine what its like when theres around 150 people in peak time! for this reason, i usually try to go in after 10pm when its quieter, but that isnt always possible. this gym needs to invest in more plates so that the handful of 20s or 15s etc. havent got to be shared between around 10 different bars/pieces of kit."
4,2023-01-05,Our Pure Gym opened late November,"our pure gym opened late november, it was a really nice place to visit, clean and tidy. the changing rooms were spotless with 2 cleaners always busy keeping it that way. now early january and not a cleaner to be seen ! i asked why the place was looking so dirty and the reply was “ the cleaner is on holiday in bulgaria” there seems to be no pride in their surroundings by the staff. i asked for a squidgy to be placed in the shower area so we could clean the shower area ourselves. ignored that request, the machines are now covered in dust, the floor area is becoming a mess too. come on pure gym sort it out it’s not hard"
3,2023-01-06,Lovely gym but...,actual gym is clean and good range of equipment. however. .  showers were blocked with hair and nowhere to privately dress.  loads of younger people congregating around equipment but not using it
3,2023-01-06,The building has had near constant…,the building has had near constant issues with burst pipes since opening which causes large portions of the suspended ceiling to collapse. because of this large areas of the gym have to be cordoned off. as this can also be quite a busy gym (the other day there were 180 users at peak times) it can be difficult to find space for a workout even if using body weight/free weights especially when large areas are inaccessible due to leaks and damage. staff seem nice. some members are a bit aggy.
1,2023-01-06,Can a member of the team please empty…,can a member of the team please empty the trash in the ladies toilets? it’s not been emptied for weeks. there’s a rotting banana and period / sanitary products over flowing in all the bins. it’s actually vile.
1,2023-01-03,Improvement needed,"improve by servicing the machines, 60% cardio machines not working, mens toilets stink and sanitising gel needs topping up regularly"
1,2023-01-06,Cannot seem to change my home gym so i…,cannot seem to change my home gym so i send an email and get an automated response telling me to cancel and restart. i don’t wanna pay more money to do that. why is it so hard to change my home gym??
1,2023-01-06,Please don’t sign up,please don’t sign up; every avenue i have been ignored for my refund request which is in the terms and conditions to give back if not satisfied this is illegal and i have evidence that they are gaslighting customers to keep this money; it’s beyond legal and if anyone can take it to court please do. i had a bad turn as i’m disabled and they said they didn’t understand and ignored loads of emails and on facebook just ignored my messages. it’s beyond human and morally wrong.
4,2023-01-06,Any chance of a Bosu?,good value overall.  could we get a bosu for the gym though? i need to do balance training for my physio and the exercises require one.
5,2023-01-06,Great value for money with a wide range of equipment and excellent staff,"spacious gym with a wide range of clean and well maintained equipment, all with clear instructions and app supported videos and workouts/classes as part of the membership package (i have off-peak). excellent value for money and opportunities for a more personal training experience from qualified onsite trainers if you want to go down the same route as i did with ravi (moc) who is a 1st class pt who is pushing me to my goals with a varied and complete package"
5,2023-01-05,No chance of me changing gym,"i am a puregym plus member and use multiple puregyms across the country in any given 12 month period. generally speaking, every puregym i have visited has had all of the equipment i have needed for a great workout and the quality of the equipment is always great. an added bonus that i love about being a plus member is that mostly all of the puregyms i have been to have a yanga water machine. these are worth the additional £5 i pay to be a plus member alone!"
2,2023-01-05,Just stopped classes at 5.30pm,"i first joined to go to classes after work and mon, tues, and thurs @ 5.30 pm was the ideal time to go on the way home. they have now just stopped the classes stating there is no staff to run them, i complained saying the ladies in the classes were disappointed, and could they please consider bringing them back or we would have to look at other gyms, the manager basically said go then, she didnt care."
2,2023-01-05,Standards have dropped,les mills classes were never brought back after covid. i appreciate times are tough and they may be more expensive but they weren’t even replaced with an equivalent. now no studio classes on a saturday morning.  also less choice of evening spin classes as there used to be options of 6pm and 7pm classes but now just one. the bikes were replaced in the refurb just a few months ago but some are already out of order. nothing seems to be maintained or followed up as issues aren’t resolved from one week to the next.  not a fan of the new layout. the cardio machines are under such a low ceiling you can touch it - bizarre. most machines now face a wall so it’s just claustrophobic. the alternative is machines directly as you come in the door which i find intimidating as everyone is looking at you as they come in.
1,2023-01-05,Customer service is absolutely…,"customer service is absolutely appalling. everything you say they just have one response.  they dont allow you to easily cancel membership or to freeze and unfreeze because they want to keep taking money from you.  other than the customer service, website and app being appalling. the gyms are actually not bad."
2,2023-01-03,This review is only about the lack of air conditioning,"this review is only about the air conditioning problems at the gym. the trainers, classes, equipment, etc. are all wonderful. but after waiting years for decent air conditioning and air circulation, and living through months of disruption due to the refurbishment - the problem with air still has not been addressed. the new functional room is totally without a/c. it is a most unpleasant place to train despite the wonderful new equipment and setup. the main gym floor is also very stuffy and tends to smell. when one enters the gym via the pods one is hit with stale, heavy air and a putrid smell. the studio and spin room are pretty good, admittedly! thank you for that at least! at this time of year there are many new members due to all of the new years resolutions to get in shape. as a gym regular i hear many complaining as the gym is advertised as having a/c but it does not feel like that once inside. i have spoken with the lovely manager and it seems as if he cannot control the a/c. please may i ask that you look at this seriously and consider the health implications of training in hot, still air. thank you very much."
2,2023-01-03,Don’t look like the place had…,don’t look like the place had refurbishment. not clean & equipment damaged. prices have increased. not worth it.
3,2023-01-04,Recently over the Christmas period,"recently over the christmas period, when entering the female changing rooms there is a smell. this smell is the drains i believe in the showers which need cleaned, working in a leisure facility myself i can smell a dirty drain a mile off. it’s been lingering for a few weeks now but just getting worse, i think someone needs to pop up the drain grills and have a look as it will only get worse."
4,2023-01-04,Very good gym has plenty to offer with…,very good gym has plenty to offer with cardio machines and good resistance weights very clean gym overall i did find it had no wi-fi  wish is a shame also has potential for more space as a second floor could be created as it has a lot of overhead space which could benefit with more treadmill and cardio equipment as when it’s busy you can’t get on machines
1,2022-12-17,As soon as you walk in there is an…,"as soon as you walk in there is an awful smell in the air of body odour, overall the gym smells unhygienic, it definitely needs a deep clean. i think they should also change the off peak times and evenings should start from 7pm as 8:30pm tends to get quite late."
3,2022-12-31,Look I understand PureGym is Value for…,look i understand puregym is value for money but i’m sick of paying money to stand in line waiting on stair machines skiers or row machines! i won’t even start on the air bike! good lord get some batteries!!! stair machines we have 4 in total and 2 out of order for weeks! rowers never have batteries and the air bike i use the clock on the wall. the manger is great and always there to help and listen but i feel like she’s also getting let down! 5000 members that are getting more and more bored of paying!

1,2023-01-04,Unacceptably dirty,"visited at 12.30pm today.  it was very tatty and dirty, no soap in men’s changing rooms, no disinfectant spray at cleaning stations.  all while the speakers broadcast messages about puregym’s commitment to safe, hygienic gyms.  wouldn’t take much to improve this but a start would be staff cleaning the place."
4,2023-01-04,I've been a member of this gym for a…,"ive been a member of this gym for a few months now and overall, i am very happy with it. the equipment is well-maintained and there are always plenty of treadmills and weight machines available. the staff is also friendly and helpful. the only issue ive had is with the cleanliness of the toilet in the womens locker room. it has not been consistently clean during my visits. however, this is a small issue in comparison to the overall positive experience ive had at the gym. i would still recommend it to others."
1,2023-01-04,Waited 40 minutes after ringing the…,waited 40 minutes after ringing the bell to speak to a gym instructor and no one came asked a customer to ask one to see me at the front as i was interested in joining and was told the instructor said they were too busy . thought this may have been a reasonable place for the family to join and train but with service as poor as this clearly this is not a good environment
4,2023-01-04,Good gym for now,overall a decent clean gym. i would suggest the gym buys more ropes for tricep workouts as most people wonder around searching for the only 2 there.

4,2022-12-24,I've come back to training after some…,"ive come back to training after some health issues and i have found puregym works well for me most of the time. i like the layout of the gym as there is room to do your own thing, the quality of the equipments are high and clean and the staff are friendly, in particular jay (manager/ st pauls) who is always happy to help when required. the only cons in my opinion, is that the changing room and gym in general can get extremely busy but the app helps by updating the number of people in gym. and for me their biggest problem is that weights and barbells are in a mess all the times, but to be fair the staff do what they can but inconsiderate members are the reason, and finally, the hydrotherapy massage table is not in all gyms."
5,2023-01-02,Good overall environment,"good overall environment, well maintained and friendly."
5,2022-12-27,LOVELY ATMOSPHERE,good availability of training equipment. nice atmosphere. charles blain is a fantastic personal trainer. he has a lovely manner and super freindly.
4,2022-12-29,Great gym with lots of space and…,great gym with lots of space and equipment. only criticism is that the music from the classes is too loud!
5,2022-12-31,Training Times,the fact able to get in at any time then the availability of the equipment even at times when reasonably busy.
3,2023-01-02,I like the gym and staff,"i like the gym and staff. equipment levels are good and not too busy.  but,.... the cleaning needs sorting. its pretty grubby and the mens changing rooms, showers and toilets smell really bad and you can see how dirty they are. also the class timetable has really dropped off over the last few months.  ive noticed other reviews regarding the cleaning situation, the reviews are validated but i see no improvements. in fact its getting worse."
2,2023-01-02,Overall cant complain much due to the…,"overall cant complain much due to the price. although a few points that hopefully get back to puregym. - the equipment looks heavily used surprising for a gym that hasnt been open that long, think puregym needs to keep replacing equipment. - the benches are hard, so hard you end up slipping from one side to the other, maybe need to look at upgrading or getting a new supplier. - the gym is too cramped, they have a very large area just for classes which for a couple classes a day that are not even busy seems like a waste of space. - the gym needs a few more cable machines as this gets really busy and could do with a few more leg machines, but i understand space is tight. - weights section is ok but again a little cramped. - biggest problem is plates, people do not put weights back, you cant find a 20kg plate for some odd reason. there are so many odd plates in wrong sections. the staff need to make sure people put the weights back in the correct place, maybe a few signs in places so people can remember its simple gym manners. - they need to now limit the amount of members in the gym, its gets really busy and if more and more sign up then there will be no room to move. - the one in ashford is much better, hopefully they can get a bigger unit or do something about the space just too rammed."
4,2023-01-02,"Great Gym, Good Value but no WiFi and very limited mobile coverage","been a member since opening. its a well equipped gym, friendly environment, its a real shame thats theres no customer wifi though, as theres no o2 or ee mobile coverage within the gym."

2,2023-01-02,More out of order equipment !!!,one of the running machines has had a out of order sign on it for now 4 weeks still non sign of it working! also the yanga drinks station (which i pay extra for monthly) has been out of order for 3 days . the issue is the management are just never around to fix these issues !!! for a gym that is open 24/7 it’s a shame the manager doesn’t seem to make more of an appearance!!!! as usual gym great but let down by poor management !

2,2023-01-02,Key Area for Improvement,"the staff are friendly and there is a wide range of equipment. unfortunately, this gym is let down by the state of cleanliness in every aspect from the changing rooms to the workout areas.  although there has been a small improvement over the last couple of weeks, there is some way to go. as a minimum paper towels need to be available to clean equipment."
3,2023-01-01,Most of the cross trainers are wonky,"most of the cross trainers are wonky. its an absolute joke. most of them are on a serious slant despite the floor being flat. they either shake when youre on them as a result or youre on an angle. its been like this for a while. otherwise, its an ok puregym. bit of a strange layout."

4,2023-01-01,Good gym with friendly staff,good gym with friendly staff. my only complaint is when there’s a class on the instructors microphone is so loud i can hear them through my noise cancelling headphones and in a separate part of the gym surely the participants can hear what they need to without the mic being so loud!
2,2022-12-17,Manager gone,manager gone kit out of action showers not working gone downhill quickly may have to change gym unfortunately
5,2022-12-30,Highly recommend it,"i couldnt be happier with my experience at puregym. by joining some of the classes on the regular and having a balanced diet, i have managed to lose 3kg (which means a lot to me). the team is genuinely brilliant, upbeat, professional, and always so approachable and helpful. some of my favorite classes so far are: metcon with ben; zumba with hannah; and legs/bums with both, rukmal and craige. thank you guys for your hard work!!"

1,2022-12-27,Worse puregym I've experienced,"fiveways/ broad street puregym is the worse puregym in birmingham (i use 10 different ones monthly) in terms of up keep of equipment & hygiene period. the male changing rooms/toilet are a disgrace ive been going there on & off for the past 2 years at one stage last year the toilet was blocked for nearly a week (you can imagine the smell) with tissue & fluids all around it on the floor. to this day the changing rooms still stinks , about a 3rd of the lockers are broke. as for the gym its self the equipment is well out of date broken or missing . all the hygiene stations are empty with no spray bottles. ive looked at the reviews only one person has mentioned some of what ive listed some have even said its the best gym in birmingham shocking. surely the manager & staff have mentioned this, or have they ?needs sorting out desperately"
4,2022-12-30,"Well equipped and great value, but not perfect","update after over 30 visits: they have replaced the woke corporate looped message with a standard safety notice - well done on that. a 4.5 stars now.  (original review) this gym has an excellent range of equipment, with some machines that are lacking in a near-by competitor. staff are helpful. in short, with current offer pricing, huge value for money.  only quibbles are, to my eyes at least, the uninspiring decor and the woke safety and inclusiveness corporate messages that irritate at regular intervals. just use the speakers for music, please! also, you need to take your mobile with you for qr code scanning, unless you want to manually enter your pin. as i dont like carting my rather bulky mobile to the gym this is a little bit inconvenient.  one other caveat, the parking is shared with busy b&m and dunelm stoes and exiting onto the main road is tricky as its often congested. however, with 24 hour opening, off peak use would mitigate this problem.  all in all, well recommended."
1,2022-12-31,Terrible Gym for people standing at…,"terrible gym for people standing at equipment whilst on their mobile phones.staff are not interested when spoken to.paisley badly needs equipment upgrade.all they have done is replace equipment like for like..nothing new.staff rarely seen in gym.usually sitting in office,or playing football outside office.guess thats what you get.....after they ""qualify "" after a 12week course.!"
5,2022-12-31,I'm not actually a member,"im not actually a member, but i popped into a branch in sydenham because ive badly sprained my ankle and i was looking for an ankle support.  the very nice young pt, marlon was most kind and helpful.  i would highly recommend pure gym in sydenham. thank you so much, marlon, and thank you to the young customer who drew marlons attention to me."
3,2022-12-30,"Andover Gym. Great gym, however….","great gym with everything you need at anytime of the day or night. however, if you truly value your health, please do not enter the men’s toilets/showers! quite frankly, they are disgusting & are unfit for public use. i’m fairly positive that if this was reported to h&s that this site would be closed, it’s that bad!"
1,2022-12-31,Used this gym for years,used this gym for years. come every morning. yes half the men’s showers aren’t working. yes the lockers are mostly broken. yes the place is desperate for an upgrade. all this i have had to accept. but turning the aircon off? i know everyone is trying to save money on energy but it’s unbearable and we are cooking in our own sweat. sort it out please
4,2022-12-30,I have used Palmers Green a couple of…,i have used palmers green a couple of times since it’s opening. it is small in comparison to any other pure gym i have used but the equipment adequate enough to have a good session. i agree with the other comments re the lockers need to be improved. also i’m a man and the unisex changing cubicle isn’t appropriate especially for women.
4,2022-12-30,Wait for the however…,"i love this gym, such a great community with friendly staff. one thing however is that it has not had any updates since it opened many years ago now. other gyms in the area including local pure gyms (crayford) have different machines i.e hip thrust machine. this has been making me spend more of my time elsewhere lately.  perhaps the equipment could be revisited/upgraded?"

1,2022-12-30,Poor poor poor!,"poor (unisex!?) changing facilities with maybe 10 or so lockers provided - shockingly inadequate!!!! the class instructors terrible, the pump classes are the worst i’ve ever attended - the air conditioning is ineffective, doesn’t service the cardio areas and seems to blow hot air rather than cool. sadly a pretty poor effort all round by pure gym!"
1,2022-12-30,Customer service is terrible!,customer service is terrible!  i experienced issues with my membership as i was charged twice. i contacted customer service on fb because there is no phone number to call. i have been trying to resolve this issue for more than 3 months. nobody is able to help me to resolve my query. extremely bad!

1,2022-12-29,Unhygienic,"still disappointed with the gym, but had to write another review because the toilets are absolutely vile! they stink and they are never cleaned there is literally grime built up in the toilet bowl literally proving that they aren’t clean! how hard is it to put some toilet cleaner in the loo and give it a scrub rather than making your customers feel absolutely vile for using the toilet! when was the last time they were cleaned? absolutely disgusting and disgraceful"
1,2022-12-29,Technical issues again!,technical issues again!! wasnt allowed entry to my gym which i pay for monthly. i drive some distance to get there aswell....this has been an ongoing problem
1,2022-12-29,Brutally Honest Review,"okay, folks, this is the review youve been looking for, strap in...   the good: 1. open 24 hours  2. it has become much less busy since jd opened, which is to the consumers benefit. perhaps around 90 people at peak time compared to 150+ prior to jds emergence.   the bad: 1. despite fewer heads in the gym, theres a ghastly smell around the free-weights area. having read some reviews, its evidently not a new problem and hasnt been fixed for a while. i can only imagine it getting worse if it isnt treated soon.   2. what in the monkeys is going on with the male toilets? why arent they ever clean? theyre never clean enough to use. this means dirty showers that are also almost see-through. if youre reading this and planning to join, be ready to hold for when youre back home.   3. puregyms music playlist is absolutely pump-killing. aint no way people are hitting prs with jess glynne - darling hold my hand.   4. theres nothing state-of-the-art about the exercise equipment. youll literally see them in every gym so dont let this be a determining point for you to choose puregym over another franchise gym. theyre literally all the same. puregym l&d is also looking to add more state-of-the-art equipment, but where are they going to put these? are you gonna leave any walking space?   5. the economics of the womens-only area will at some point or another annoy you. id say the ratio of men-women members is approx 15/1. i havent been in the womens area as a dude but i cant imagine more than 10 women in there at one given time. but its a decent size chuck of the gym (+ equipment) which the greater gender demographic is paying for but not able to use. surely there should be alternate pricing for women if its exclusive for them?   6. refreshments. it took me months to realise that there are vending machines in the gym. but, in good ol tradition, good luck finding them.   7. i havent heard a spin cycle class go on for about a month now. im sure after reading other reviews, youve uncovered another puregym l&d bonanza.   i can go on and on but to summarize, its a basic b!tch gym with nothing to brag about. if you want to go down to the pricing, jd is newer, cleaner and has more to offer and overall a better bang for your buck. unless youre local, it makes no sense to come to puregym l&d over jd.   stay blessed, ta!"

4,2022-12-22,"Clean, nice atmosphere and easy to get on with the workout.","i like going to the gym and following the workouts on the app.  it has really helped me to focus on my fitness challenges.  never too busy during the day, and the facilities are clean.  our gym is on 3 levels, and i would recommend that the cardio level has quieter music, so that we can all listen to our own music (everyone wears headphones).  otherwise - i think it is great and recommend it."
5,2022-12-28,Approach to building strength and improving fitness,"the instructors at the gym are simply outstanding. their tremendous work ethics and dedication tick all the boxes. they are so driven and focused with the determination to build strength and improve fitness. evgeni- so agile, warm, innovative and just keeps going, this is truly empowering diana- so impressive, creative, empowering and pleasant. this is truly an amazing gift. prakash. so special, kind, sincere and full of ability and potential. this is truly empowering. jeni- sweet, thoughtful, kind and artistically brilliant. this is truly uplifting and empowering. kadeem- dedicated, focused, precise with technique and timing. truly empowering. julian- committed to the task, executed with strength. this is truly empowering sereen. i did a session with her and i enjoyed every minute of it. i also had a session with the manager and it was beautifully executed and i understood that the team was in hands and the strength of their discipline. andrea b"

3,2022-12-28,"Good staff, terrible maintenance.","this is millhouses.  the staff are good, kit is good when working, not maintained. stair climbers finally repaired after several months not working. hot air hand dryer not working for several months.  one of two gents wcs has been locked off for several weeks and today the second one stopped flushing. just not acceptable. roughly comparable gym within 200 yards and that one has someone on reception. will terminate my membership and go elsewhere."

2,2022-12-27,Not the best gym.,there’s better pure gyms out there. the weights are all in the wrong areas it’s a mess. the benches are all bunched up together there’s never enough space to workout in the free weights area. the machines are way too close together. just don’t even bother. i also don’t get why it’s so dark?
3,2022-12-22,3 machines broke,"3 machines broke , one never even had a sign on it for a few days and thats the one i use , also prices i pay 19.99 a month and now its offering 14.99 and 15.99 to new customers what about old genuine customers prices should change for everyone ."
1,2022-12-28,What a headache,"terrible experience from start to finish, the site won’t apply a discount code, everytime i try speak with them i’ve waited atleast 2 days for a reply and even then their response has nothing to do with my query. like my message wasn’t even read properly. wasted so much time back and forth to eventually give up. also some mix up regarding the joining fee, there was an offer for no joining fee but the site simply won’t apply that and then when i spoke with them after a 3 day wait they said to pay it and they’ll credit it to my account but i when i seeked some kind of confirmation i received nothing. plus i’d like to mention i did pop in there to check if my membership was active at the start to be left out in the cold, a member let me in and i was approached by a member of staff who just looked at me up and down, i explained my issue and he told me he can’t help me as he has no tablet and to see a manager when they arrive, i saw the opportunity to ask about the size and equipment of the gym but when i thought about it he could’ve offered to show me around quickly. i keep trying again to arrange membership as i need a 24hour gym but keep meeting with more diss appointment."

At the very first visit to the club in…,"at the very first visit to the club in canterbury kent this evening, the desire to become a member disappeared. first of all, during registration, i received a long pincode, which when i enter did not let me in. i pressed the emergency and after 5 min a lady come down. i had explained what happened but the lady said i’m not gonna let you in, unless i see that its for the gym in sturry. at the same time my phone battery was nearly down. so i said i have chosen sturry in canterbury, i showed my pin code and confirmation email as well as my bank transaction! instead she decided that i’m having a go with her and said i’m not gonna let you in, because by showing her the evidence she decided that i’m rude.she clearly didn’t know how to speak to clients. so i needed to beg her to let me in. after she let me in, she did not try to show me around so i needed to ask clients where are the dressing rooms. awful attitude!! on the way out i asked for her name and she said, why do you need my name, i already told my boss how rude you are and won’t let you out she said. now i hope the same boss reads this and teach jodie how to speak with clients! glad i have chosen everlast gym."

3,2022-12-27,Mixed feelings,"ive been a member of puregym since it opened but i have mixed feelings about the new layout. 2 machines which i liked using were removed without any explanation (the back extension and the abdominal sidebend machine), the space to stretch/warm up with mats has been removed, there is no hand gel and only 1 cleaning station, 1 water fountain, and the tvs have all been removed. however i do like that there are now 2 leg press and leg extension machines.  ken"

2,2022-12-27,Class timetable,"i have had a good experience using skydome puregym for a number of months. however, since december i have been very disappointed about the way that classes have been organised. i understand that more staff have annual leave around christmas, but i do think that classes should be organised more effectively. it was especially disappointing to attend a spin class on christmas eve morning (along with 6 other members) only to find that the member of staff who was meant to be running the class was on annual leave. in addition to this, there are no classes available to book from january 1st onwards, i pay more for membership to allow me to book in advance (which i can’t currently do)."
1,2022-12-25,Open 24 Hours?,went to puregym sheffield city centre south on xmas day morning to find it was closed. was very disappointed as i did check on the website / twitter and facebook to check it was open and didnt see anything just how puregym is open 24 hours.  i can live with the gym being closed on xmas day but think it was very poor customer service not to inform members of xmas opening hours on social media. what other times are you closed over the holiday period?

5,2022-12-20,I feel relaxed here,"had a great induction with paul. very knowable and friendly. excellent gym with lots of kit to choose from. a great range of classes; excellent cycle class with paul. great lbt with emma. the staff are really friendly and always helpful. the pt’s are always around to give you tips on your workouts. paul really knowledgeable with glute strengthening; given some good glute strengthening exercises. if you are like me and prefer the glute thrust machine to using a barbell, youll be ok here. i feel relaxed here. will recommend."
4,2022-12-26,Overall very good gym!!,"overall very good gym!! while small, i would say it’s better equipped than the stirling puregym due to better squat racks and olympic plates. even though the locker area is mixed gender, the toilets and showers are separated into small individual rooms with locks, so no one else will be in you’re shower/toilet room. if you are like me and prefer using a barbell hip thrust over the machine hip thrust, you will need to bring you’re own barbell pad. excellent commercial gym, however if you are someone who specialises in powerlifting and olympic lifting, there are no crash pads for dropping heavy weights, so make sure you are able to safely place them down as you don’t want to damage equipment."

2,2022-12-22,Dated equipment. Desperate for a refurb,"dated equipment yet the company have the cheek to constantly put the prices up. the gym is in desperate need of a refurb, and no, not just a lick of paint. half the kit looks like it’s been chewed. better off going to the gym group where they update the kit regularly"

1,2022-12-25,Yeah the '24x7' app-controlled gym that…,yeah the 24x7 app-controlled gym that simply closes when it feels like it. and the only way you find out is by going all the way there ... to find some idiot has pasted a piece of paper in the window. they clearly dont give a monkeys about their customers. clearly to much effort for them to make the actual not-24x7 hours opening visible in their app or to text their customers if they simply dont feel like opening.
1,2022-12-25,Scamming people,it states 24hrs gym and they are closed down early. so i got these day passes and i booked them for christmas and to find out its closed. at least let us know when booking the day pass that the gym isn’t open for holiday. or state that the gym isn’t 24hr open. that’s a misleading information.

5,2022-12-23,Good New Layout,"overall i have found the new gym layout good, and works well for me. the only problem i have found is the bars in the new functional zone are too close to the overhang in the ceiling, why would you do that. this makes them no use for some calisthenics exercises. they need to be moved forward a few feet. mostly though its a good place, staff are friendly and the manager is always willing to have a chat about any concerns."
5,2022-12-19,I don’t understand the negative…,"i think some people have lost the plot, if you feel cold in the gym it means you’re not working hard enough. when you exercise you body temperature rises if the temperature is too high can effect the body, poor reason to leave a bad review!  how can you complain about attitude of staff, why don’t these people mention their approach to the staff in the first place ?  100’s people come to this gym, and the reflection on reviews is not accurate about the true feelings of users.  i don’t understand the negative feedback, i have been coming here for about 3 plus years now and standards have remained consistent. all staff are always friendly and polite to me. i can’t bare to think of a life with arcadian pure gym !!"
3,2022-12-24,I love working out here,"i love working out here, but some people just don’t know how to be respectful of others like slamming the the bar down when doing a dead lift what’s that gonna do apart from annoy people, it’s annoying and useful to no one, also why so many running machines just go outside on a run make room for more proper equipment, apart from that it’s great love it, just needs to be managed a bit better and for the management to rethink the layout maybe?"

1,2022-12-21,The gym has been closed since Saturday…,"the gym has been closed since saturday 16th of december with no advance warning of its closure. they couldnt even be bothered to send out a generic email to all of its customers, i arrived on 4 different days to discover that it was closed with a hand written notice in the window. i only received an email after i attempted to put my pin number in the front door in an attempt to gain access.  i have cancelled my membership and joined another gym, as this is the second time this has happened in the last 6 months. disgraceful level of service. avoid at all costs."

3,2022-12-23,I really like the new layout of the gym…,"i really like the new layout of the gym as it’s been redone recently, but the air conditioning is still non existent. the weighted dumbbell section of the gym is so unorganised all the dumbbells are in so many different places in the area as well as them being left on the floor and the pts working have put no effort in putting them away. some of the people that come to this gym have no idea what they’re doing and have not been given a proper induction by the pts if this continues people will be injuring themselves."

4,2022-12-21,Positive Steps,"new weights? good new benches? awesome! staff? super friendly (shoutout to craige & tannika) hand sanitizer? only near sports drink. not in entrance. not on 1st floor. please fix this! have cleaners refill them! also, maybe more trash cans (esp. upstairs) would prevent littering by members."
1,2022-12-22,Get the maintainance people in!,"what is going on? the car park has a lake in the middle of it because you cant be bothered to get the drains fixed. no lights in the car park and the upper floor of the gym had some lights out. then treadmills, stairmasters and other kit has been turned off at the mains why? this is very poor and it feels like youve just abandoned your maintainance regime which always used to be good."
3,2022-12-22,Hmmm,although a quiet gym staff arent friendly
4,2022-12-22,Highly recommend,its open 24 hours which is amazing. loads of equipment to choose from. im really happy with this gym. the only change id make is the gym being cooler and some warmth in the changing rooms. absolutely freezing. i wish i could swap the temperatures round.

1,2022-12-21,Dreadful,"i have been a member on and off for a good number of years and the gym has never been great but, its cheap and does the job. however, not once in the years that i have been a member, can i recall the air conditioning ever working. its always unbearably hot in the summer and painfully cold in the winter. communications from the gym always seem to claim that its being fixed or being looked into but it never changes - ive seen pts walking around in woolly hats this year for godness sake!  but last night was the final straw that broke the camels back, there was a sign in the ladies changing rooms that said male cleaner in attendance, but it looked as though no cleaner, male or otherwise, had been in over a week - it was grotty. i was then delighted to having to take a cold shower, as there appeared to be no hot water and for the showers to flood through the drains during the already pleasant experience.  theres a reason this gym is so cheap and its not to give customers good value for money. very poor."
1,2022-12-22,no Ability to contact you phone/ email,we cancelled the account via the website and didnt get confirmation. there is no phone contact number and your email box is full.
1,2022-12-20,puregrim,"when i joined the burnham puregym it was ok as a budget 24 hour gym but over the last year it has got worse and worse. they claim its a 24/7 365 gym as displayed at the entrance of my local gym but this in fact is a lie because they randomly close for reasons like the queens death, xmas eve, xmas day etc... they should not be making false claims to deceive people. also recently they have began to turn the carpark lights off at night resulting in higher crime such as car break ins and cars being stolen, due to the lack of light their cctv cameras are deemed useless so the chance of catching the criminals is almost zero. during the day the heating is too high and at night it is off meaning its almost impossible to train due to the extremities of temperature. they also shut the main toilets at night which means that if the only disabled toilet is blocked as it has been for the last 2 days you are stuffed. i complained about the shower in the disabled toilet either being stone cold or very hot last january and after being passed around a few times nothing has been done as the mixer valve is still not mixing. the way things are trending i would not recommend pure gym to anyone and if things are not improved i will be moving elswhere"

1,2022-12-21,Panto show,"was a decent gym but standards and vibe really have slipped.  - classes are cancelled with little notice and staff don’t turn up to run them. there’s no contact or apology from the management about this even when they are contacted. there’s a joke around the gym that the gym manager is non existent and he never replies to emails - timetable of classes are changed to suit the needs of staff ie the type of class and time it is run. can you please stop doing this you are messing with members plan and interest. - classes are shorted again to suit the staff - why are 45 min classes reduced to 30mins!? - most popular classes ie spin and combat (used to be oversubscribed) are either cancelled and significantly reduced. please get trainers who can deliver these and are good. or are you planning to stop spin all together is what has been floated but no response from management about this - circuit has been taken off the timetable in the evening- why don’t they have a pt to run these? - every wednesday the pt for evening classes disappeared, not sure if sick but classes are cancelled all last minute - gym said they were going to get a punch bag and run pad work classes. this still has not happened - gym is struggling to recruit - the staff look miserable. lots of staff have left and this seems to be the case for this branch - dirty! can see the dirt even when the room is dark.even the studio. shower doors are see through even though fed back by loads to fix this, it takes a simple stick on to be added. i haven’t had a shower in ages. - can you put the name of the instructor doing the class on the timetable. don’t just say fitness team as you tell us you don’t know what is happening  - manager and staff have their favourites, you will see the blokes flirting with the users.  patricia is a godsend to the gym but will run herself in the ground as she covers absences, leave and sickness. womens area is good and can there be a smith machine put in?  it’s sad really as it seems the gym are no longer taking on feedback and care. the previous management used to listen and inform adjustments. people are leaving because of the standards and not because jd opened. please sort it out and stop giving standard responses to reviews and be genuine, personalable and have passionate care in your work. it is our health you are affecting and no doubt your own if you are not happy and enjoying work"

2,2022-12-21,Following the recent renovations in…,following the recent renovations in puregym boucher road belfast i am confused and frustrated by some of the decisions made. the changing rooms have so few lockers now and everyone is crammed into one area while the rest of the changing room sits vacant. many of the patrons feel the same way. there is nowhere for anyone to move to and set their gym gear to get ready separately. no seats for people who need help or even just a feeling of space and support to get dressed away from others. the walk in cubicles provide privacy but that is all. surely after the pandemic this is not wise. the customer has not been considered properly here. the lockers are as small as ever. no efforts were made to make the changing room a better experience. rather the renovation has meant the changing rooms have suffered. additionally there is equipment placed on the gym floor in the most ridiculous areas so that people have to move sideways to get past or the user has to stop so that they can let people pass by safely eg bottom of steps. moreover after all this work the showers have remained the same… outdated and poorly lit. the bulb in the last shower is still not working properly as it has done for years. compare the showers in lisburn puregym and there is a big difference

1,2022-12-20,Did you even read my reply properly!,this is a reply to your response. i have spoken to the gym staff who have advised myself and others that your pure gym hierarchy are fully aware of the air con not working but are choosing to do nothing about it. the staff have stated and i’ll quote there is nothing they can do it has been reported to the decision makers but still nothing has been done! so i don’t accept your response about reporting it to the staff as we have and being told to make complaints so you all sort it out.  you have not mentioned anything else about the other topics i brought up just goes to show they put any person to respond back to make it look like they seem to care. sort it out!
3,2022-12-21,My PureGym experience,really nice trainers and good atmosphere in the gym. easy to access and good volume of equipment. easy to use app and booking system. the downside when freezing membership you have to pay £6.99 per month to do so. i broke my ankle so will be in a cast for 10-12 weeks. when i asked if it was possible to pay the one £6:99 only and freeze membership for 3 months in that i am physically unable to go to the gym and i would be paying each month for facilities i cannot use i got an automated message showing how to cancel my membership. so basically fine if you’re fit. your a number and not a person.

1,2022-12-18,closed with no warning,"this used to be my favourite gym however since i have visited home for the last few days the gym has been closed with no explanation. i went yesterday afternoon and there was a hand written sign in the window saying the gym was temporarily closed. i went again this morning and the sign was still there. we were given no warning that the gym would be closed and no advice as to when it will be open. i guess they expect us to just show up everyday just in case. on top of this, parking is validated in the gym so each time i have visited and the gym is closed i have had to pay for my parking. there is no number to call or anyone to speak to either. wonder when i’m going to get these few days refunded as well as my parking reimbursed!!"

2,2022-12-17,Not great,"so many issues with this gym, it’s not terrible but it’s also not surprising they’ve lost members to jd.  would be nice if they remember it’s a gym and people train there - the temperature is often far too hot… like most mornings! not very clean. equipment/machines when broken take far too long to get fixed. machines not looked after. laying leg curl machine moved to women’s only area which is rather sexist and not fair that there isn’t another for unisex use when it’s always been a very popular machine. as a female i don’t want to train in the ladies only area - so find this frustrating. machines are too close together and on fridays the functional area is used for a class over the studio… and the music for it is so loud it drowns out anything in your headphones. supposed to be a 24/7 gym, 365 days of the year which is why we picked puregym…. but now it’s reduced it’s opened hours and closed on christmas day? odd as it was open last year…  all in all it’s a shame because the gym could be great, if it was in the right hands."

4,2022-12-17,Good value and generally a good gym,"good value and generally a good gym! i think some small things would really help to make it better - if the ladies toilets didn’t always have 1 or 2 out of 3 toilets out of order. one time all 3 weren’t working with no other facility available. in addition to this, the shower facilities really need to have somewhere you can keep your stuff dry while you are showering. there are hooks but i’m personally not the kind of women who likes walking out naked in public. even a hook immediately on the outside of the shower would be helpful but they are on the opposite wall."

4,2022-12-18,I like the fact the gym is open 24hrs,"i like the fact the gym is open 24hrs, but the 2 improvements i would like, is for the female toilets to be cleaned better or air freshener to be used, because it often smells badly plus the female changing room should be open 24hrs a day, rather than forcing men and women to use the one small toilet"

2,2022-12-18,Rapidly gone downhill,"rapidly gone downhill, plenty of equipment out of order and moved to places on other side of gym in a refit making your workout more awkward. triceps machines nowhere near free weights so can’t link into workout as may be taken by time to get to it. equipment dusty and unclean, showers filthy, water in showers on verge of freezing in the winter, half the lockers don’t work. the biggest pet peeve in the years i’ve been here is that they have stacks of the heavier free weights and only a handful of the 2-14kg - most of the people who workout here are lean so there aren’t enough available weights at most times of the day.  why do i still go here after all this and still give it 2*? price, opening hours and location. that’s it."
4,2022-12-17,My experience in pure gym have been…,"my experience in pure gym have been good, every time that i go to train, i can train without problem using all the required equipment that you have in all yours branch. just, could you put mirrors in the rack for lifting that you have in the back part in your branch in leytonstone?. there are only one rack with mirror. it could be better because we can see how we are doing our technique. thank you"

5,2022-12-18,Good classes,the timetables for the classes are very good
3,2022-12-17,Class Cancellations!,"disappointed that several classes have been cancelled last week at very short notice. classes currently very limited which i appreciate is down to reduced staff levels . junior seris classes fantastic as ever, fun, motivating and professional -thank you ! disappointing when you sign up for class as you like the trainer and it is a different person doing class because they are having to undertake on the cleaning duties of loos and changing rooms- where are the cleaning staff?! puregym should appreciate the staff at bedford, great team but they need more support and a massive thank you at christmas. this recent experience has made me think about looking elsewhere for first time in about 10 years of being a pg member."

4,2022-12-18,Pretty decent gym,"pretty decent gym. music is pretty bad for a gym though and everytime there’s a class on that seems to take over the music system for the full gym, and to be honest the music for the classes is better than the normal music. apart from that, no complaints"

3,2022-12-17,Poor Public Announcements,"everything is great in that gym. the only tiny thing that you might want to improve is the quality of the public announcements. occasionally, the voice of a girl comes on the speakers, clearly making some kind of important announcement, but i havent met anyone yet you can hear it. the recording is bad such that the words seem to lack any enunciation. she could be talking about fire procedures or giving us a her recipe for the perfect flapjacks: i havent a clue!"

1,2022-12-17,Pure Gym - Poor Gym,"pure gym provides basic level equipment and facilities for its members which are beneficial for regular gym-goers and fitness enthusiasts. however when compared with national competitors such as ‘the gym group’ & ‘pump gyms’ it completely fails to stack up. as a member of both of these gyms, i have found there to be not only far more space to train but also a much wider variety of equipment. this is provided at a far lower monthly cost with pump gyms being nearly half the price i pay at pure gyms. furthermore these gyms have no egregious joining fee if £50 which members are forced to commit to before being comfortable with the service provided. as a result i seek to terminate my membership at burgess hill pure gym for an alternative as almost any other option within the area would suffice compared to this."

4,2022-12-17,Pretty good overall,pros - good friendly environment. clean equipment. comfortable temperature. not too busy majority of the time.  cons- not enough total equipment and variety for leg training. only muscle group that can be hard to do due to equipment being busy. also need more platted weights for machines and barbells
2,2022-12-17,I am a customer since opening of PG in…,i am a customer since opening of pg in bridgwater. unfortunately there is no changes in equipment since gym was open. the heaviest dumbells are 40 kg. some machines are just waste of space for example chest press/ shoulder press. space could be better used and definitely more free weights is needed and benches as well. overall few years passed since opening and theres no changes in set up and equipment.

4,2022-12-17,Really decent Gym at a good price,cracking gym for the money and it’s open 24/7 only downside is the rubbish and general cleanliness of the gym and in the changing rooms. seems to be a lack of cleaning products for after use of the machines

3,2022-12-17,Kit not repaired and was quite chilly,gym was not too busy. but we noticed that there were several pieces of kit that were out of order which have been out of order for a few weeks now ( eg 2 out of the 3 stair climbing machines). this does happen quite often. they should ensure they have the right support in place to get their kit fixed more promptly.  it’s also very cold in some areas of the gym. it must be getting a direct blast from the air con units. it doesn’t need to be that cold. i did notice many more people with sweat shirts on than i seem to remember normally.
2,2022-12-17,There were a number of issues with my…,there were a number of issues with my visit to the gym today 1) several of the treadmills are out of order 2) after my run there was no paper or cleaning equipment to clean the treadmill down i did not use the dressing rooms today but did earlier in the week. a number of the lockers are damaged and not fit for use. i understand that pure gym’s business model is to provide a cheaper more accessible gym experience for all to enjoy. nonetheless i think there are a number of things within the new barnet gym that could be improved upon.

3,2022-12-17,Lack of heating in Gym,"on each time i have attended the gym this week there has been no heating on. given that we have been experiencing sub zero temperatures this has led to a poor environment in which to train. having raised the issue with one of the personal trainers, they commented that a large number of members had raised the same concern. whilst in the gym i witnessed members expressing their dissatisfaction to each other. if this is a national policy, it has had a very negative effect."

5,2022-12-17,Dundee - Great gym for newbies and experienced alike.,"great gym, loads of new equipment just added. the place is clean and mostly kept tidy and one of the main things i like is there are a lot of separate parts of the gym so you dont feel youre just in a huge space so if youre trying something new and feel like an idiot then you can take some comfort from the fact that not everyone can see you =), plus they listen to feedback, cant fault them. wee note on the parking for those who are looking to join, the parking out back is 45mins max but you can get a little longer without fear id say 1hr15 or so (a risk but i have never seen a parking attendant there) plus if youre there before 8am there is no restriction until 845am and none after 6pm or sundays. its doable."
3,2022-12-17,Overall environment of the gym is very…,"overall environment of the gym is very friendly and welcoming, equipment and facilities like the shower rooms are very clean and the staff are friendly. however there is a big issue with a shortage in equipment, particularly carabinders for the cable machines. some equipment is frequently broken as well, making it a bit difficult to work on specific exercises. there could be more weights as well, more dumbbells and plates of the same weight as it is sometimes very hard to find the weight you need. especially when the gym is busy, i see a lot of other gym goers having the same problem as me (i.e. spending precious minutes walking around the gym trying to find the specific plates they need). it would make for a much more efficient and enjoyable workout if there were just a bit more plates and dumbbells around for everyone to use."

1,2022-12-17,Going down hill fast,"i have been debating writing a review for a while given that i loved this gym but similar to the other recent reviews that have been left, unfortunately the gym has gone down hill very fast and something needs to change. as someone else mentioned, cleaning now seems to be non-existent, all but 2 of the mens showers are out of order, the showers that are in order never seem to be cleaned, the changing rooms also seem very grubby (the floor needs a deep clean for sure) and there is clearly something wrong with the drainage system given the bad smell that comes from the sinks. its a real shame as the gym itself is still fine but its now noticeable how things arent monitored anymore.  i still love this gym and i think that with a few improvements as highlighted above, it could be back to what it was. something just needs to change otherwise i feel members will be looking to join a different one. for the first time i have started looking around at other options. come on puregym help us out."

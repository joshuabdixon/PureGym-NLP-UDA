    "This notebook uses an instruction-tuned large language model (Falcon) to extract concise topics from negative Trustpilot reviews, and then applies BERTopic to cluster and summarise those extracted topics. The main steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loading the raw filtered review dataset and filtering to negative reviews using rating thresholds defined in the project configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optionally sub-sampling the negative reviews for faster experimentation (`SAMPLE_SIZE`), while keeping sampling reproducible via a fixed random seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Running batched topic extraction with the Hugging Face text-generation pipeline using **Falcon-H1-1.5B-Instruct** (`tiiuae/Falcon-H1-1.5B-Instruct`), constrained by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * a fixed prompt template\n",
    "\n",
    "  * maximum input length (`MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * deterministic decoding (greedy generation with `DO_SAMPLE=False`) for reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing (using `TextPreproccessor`), parsing and normalising the generated output to extract exactly three short topics per review and filtering out rows with empty or invalid extractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Saving the generated topics and cleaned topic strings as CSV outputs for reporting and downstream modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fitting BERTopic (using `BERTopicRunner`) on the cleaned and preprocessed LLM-generated topic strings to identify recurring themes and produce topic-level summaries and visualisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook saves outputs to the configured directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extracted topics and filtered results (CSV): `output/tables/07_topic_modelling_falcon/`\n",
    "\n",
    "* BERTopic plots (PNG/HTML where applicable): `output/plots/07_topic_modelling_falcon/`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Saved BERTopic models: `output/models/07_topic_modelling_falcon/`\n",

    "All experiments were run locally on a MacBook Pro (16-inch, Nov 2024) equipped with an Apple M4 Pro chip (14 CPU cores: 10 performance and 4 efficiency cores) and 24 GB of unified memory, running macOS Tahoe 26.2. Model inference was executed locally; where available, the pipeline can use Apple Silicon acceleration via MPS, otherwise it falls back to CPU. No distributed computing frameworks (e.g. SLURM or OpenPBS) were used. **The notebook has been tested on CPU and Apple Silicon (MPS); CUDA support is included for completeness but has not been validated in this project.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is implemented in Python and relies primarily on pandas, numpy, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers (AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, and pipeline), alongside project-specific utilities for prompt-based topic extraction and BERTopic clustering. For reproducibility, a fixed random seed of **901** was used, and deterministic text generation settings were applied (greedy decoding).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime:** On the above hardware, the notebook completes in approximately **4 hours** (MPS) when run on all negative reviews, with runtime dominated by LLM inference (tokenisation and generation). It is recommended **SAMPLE_SIZE = 10** (increase if desired) is set for checking functionality for approximately **1min**.\n",

       "16                            joined my local puregym when the zero joining fee was on except my local gym was exempt from it and i was charged £15 joining fee. was ready to train over the festive period but i cant do that as my local puregym is closed through out the festive period due to staff shortage... a company thay adverises itself as 24/7 365 days access yet i can not access it when i want because its closed. makes no sence having a policy in place if managers just abuse it. futher more my conversion with the manager team should have stayed between us, our conversion transcript shouldnt have been shared with the staff.   \n",
       "17  almost a week with the gym shut and we still haven’t received a single email with an update on how to proceed. i can’t go to any other gyms like (finsbury park) being the nearest one - hence why i joined my local in seven sisters and not the other ones. i have to keep coming to check if the gym is re-opened every day because they have absolutely no commitment in keeping us in the loop. there’s no maintenance being carried out to try to solve the problem. it’s making me think that all this was a catch the £16.99 for the first 6 months offer - and they want us to cancel our membership which has now gone up to £24.99 a month.   \n",

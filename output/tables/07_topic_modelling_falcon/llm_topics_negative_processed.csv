1,2023-12-17,Absolute lack of respect with its customers!!!!!,almost a week with the gym shut and we still haven’t received a single email with an update on how to proceed. i can’t go to any other gyms like (finsbury park) being the nearest one - hence why i joined my local in seven sisters and not the other ones. i have to keep coming to check if the gym is re-opened every day because they have absolutely no commitment in keeping us in the loop. there’s no maintenance being carried out to try to solve the problem. it’s making me think that all this was a catch the £16.99 for the first 6 months offer - and they want us to cancel our membership which has now gone up to £24.99 a month.," i’m not sure if i’ll ever get my money back.

1,2023-12-13,Not worth the price & lack of customer service,"i was so excited about puregym opening as it’s a 2 minute walk from my house and i can quickly go home and shower and go straight to work.  that was the only reason i joined as i was a member with the gym group and cannot fault their service.  the second reason i joined is they were having a promotional offer of £16.99 ( if you joined before they opened ) for the first six months and then the price increases to £32.99!  puregym need to rethink this price increase as members want value for money and they aren’t providing this.  for example: the constructed layout is small, and i expected a much bigger space for the price. there is too much wasted space and the deadlift rack could have been 6 instead of three and there are no mirrors by this area so you can’t see a side angle.  in addition the way the back extension has been positioned you can’t see a side angle as there is only one long mirror by the dumbbells and you don’t have a front view as it’s been placed in front of a pillar.  i discovered that the cable machines had the wrong stickers on each of the weights so if you thought you were choosing 2.3kg for example it was really 4.3kg. there should have been a sign informing members about this.  where the landline is positioned they have placed a carpet by the window / open doors so if it rains the water comes through and makes the carpet extremely wet.  i discovered this as i was using the landmine in a seated position and my tracksuit bottoms were soaked. i informed the manager and no sign was placed to inform other members.  whoever designed the gym left out critical elements. this gym is missing some key machines: biceps curl, triceps press, lat pulldown, lateral raise, calf press, hack squat and there is a very low amount of cardio machines for this price. for example there is only one upright bike.  there is a good amount of cable machines, but i couldn’t believe they don’t provide a cable straight bar which is the most used attachment for cable machines and a narrow grip landmine handle & row attachment. this is shocking. there is a good amount of functional stuff and that’s about it.  when puregym opened its doors to the public the first thing i was shocked about was the fact that the changing area, toilets/showers and lockers are all on the same floor and shared between men and women.  there aren’t enough lockers for members and they have also provided open shelves for people to put their possessions in which is ridiculous as there is a sign that says puregym can’t be held accountable for anything that goes missing. why didn’t they just provide more lockers?  my frustrations have increased as they opened on the 01/12/2023 and closed 13/12/2023 and didn’t send an email out to members telling us. i found out by going to the gym and seeing a sign saying the place has shut down due to a facilities issue and to use the closest gym to me.  this is a joke as the main reason i joined was the close proximity and the closest to me would be crouch hill, finsbury park or muswell hill which means an additional cost to pay for transport and the distance doesn’t work for me.  when i contacted customer service the only option i was given was to freeze my membership which i would have to pay £6.99 for each month.  i find this preposterous as no emails have been sent out to update members as to when the gym will open again. i could pay £6.99 to freeze my membership and they open tomorrow. we’ve been told to just keep an eye out for an email. this is shocking.  the gym group never do this. they give you a timeframe and keep you updated constantly. if i’m made to pay to freeze my membership i’m cancelling my membership. i feel a lot of members will leave after the first six months as the price increase doesn’t reflect the quality of this gym.", i went to return the membership card i was told that i had to pay £16.99 deposit which i had already paid.  the,99 deposit which i had already paid.  the

1,2023-08-22,SEXUAL HARASSMENT at PUREGYM EDINBURGH…,"sexual harassment at puregym edinburgh craigleith retail park. females beware - sexual predators are infecting this 24 hour gym. my 20 year old daughter was subjected to horrendous sexual attention by 4, yes 4, eastern european men when she attended the gym at 9pm. these “men” ranged in age from mid 20s to mid 40s, so not stupid kids. they surrounded the machine my daughter was using pointing at her and making lewd remarks. she was petrified and tried to ignore these people. luckily there was still a trainer on site and he came and stood with her. he said that the gym was aware of the problem but could do little as they were scared of being labelled “racist”! what is happening with this company when the sensitivities of people like this take precedence over the safety of young women? my wife just happened to pick my daughter up and these “men” were still outside waiting in 2 separate cars. god knows what would have happened if my daughter was forced to walk home through what is a dimly lit walkway with these predators there. when she arrived home she burst in to floods of tears. i am calling on puregym to show zero tolerance to people like this and cancel their membership straight away. they were caught on the cctv so the evidence is there. i am waiting to speak to the manager, once he is available that is, and once my daughter feels confident she can face it. the trainer that helped her knew this was a problem so it’s not as if the problem will come as a surprise to management. i also want to involve the police if my daughter is agreeable as i don’t want other young females to be subjected to this appalling behaviour. come on puregym, sexual harassment in your properties is never, ever acceptable. also, there were a number of male gym users there when this was happening but they never said anything even though they were aware it was going on. if you see it, call it out. if you’re a bit apprehensive then call the police, you could help a young woman out of a terrible predicament. puregym - zero tolerance of sexual harassment now."," cancel membership immediately.

1,2023-08-17,The dirtiest gym in Stratford,"i took out a membership this week at pure gym stratford and to say i was disgusted is an understatement. this past week i use the gym from around 4:30am till 6:30am and i can not believe the state of a 6 month old gym. firstly when entering you can see protien powder on the floor near the entrance which on the first day i assumed must be recent but the exact same patch was there on thursday 3 days later and hadnt looked like it was cleaned. multiple machines have out of order signs on them which is fine whilst the gym is empty but for multiple machines to be out of service for 4 days seems extremely uncaring. typical gyms or any public space tend to be their cleanest in the mornings as cleaning usually takes place at the end of shifts in most businesses but shockingly ive seen the same opened cans of redbud, spilled protein powder, electrolyte drink bottle and various other food wrapper and drink items left around the gym day after day. id like to assume that the staff are doing their best but to see the same rubbish for 4 days repeatedly is astounding. the weights have never been easy to find wether im looking for a specific dumbbell or plate which is inconvenient but i can blame users of the gym over the staff in this case but to see weights left in the same place between days seems strange considering this gym should be busy.  the biggest issue with this gym by far is the mens changing rooms. i can not explain the full extent of its filth. the horrible smell is actual putrid, the toilet cubicles have immense amounts of dirty toilet paper on the floor around them, there are stains on the floor and benches and what looks like hair and snot in the showers. i can not understand how there is not daily cleaning with a business of this kind. and there no sanitary stations like in other gyms. its a shame as the pure gym in stratford seems to be affordable considering the rapid growth of the local area but this gym either needs to increase its price to starve the less respecting customers and allow the rest to value the gym more as well as providing cleaning equipment so members can clean after themselves. and there needs to be some sort of cleaning schedule as i can not comprehend why its in such a state. i honestly would rather have a refund of the month and joining fee because this is genuinely shocking. i very much expect a bs corporate response but action needs to be taken immediately."," i feel this gym is not fit for purpose.

2,2023-07-21,So much promise with such little delivery.,"the kit here is not bad at all, albeit skewed towards weights rather than cardio. in busy periods the (lack of) cardio kit can prove an achilles heel and having to wait for it can be frustrating. a little more thought towards the layout could actually fit more cross trainers / bikes in so this is something that would improve the place. free weights area is good. plenty of selection and kit. people are mostly tidy and put their kit back back, but as per other gyms this isn’t always the case. there are however some fairly big issues, hence the two stars. all of which could be easily resolved but the on site staff/ puregym as a company seem reluctant to do.  * male changing rooms. these are consistently dirty, even after the cleaners have just cleaned (if you ever witness the cleaners doing their job you’ll see why - very poor). the showers are also a bone of contention, and with only three to begin with the fact that they are now down to one shower for an entire male changing room in a busy gym is unacceptable. one of the out of order showers has had a broken door for 7 weeks, again unacceptable. inside of the lockers is consistently dirty too and many lockers have the locks left on all week, again not enforced by the staff.  * the rules are not enforced. there are multiple printed out sheets telling you of them , (they love a laminated document and some blu tac here), but little enforcement. groups of young males training vocally, not putting their kit back and half clothed doesn’t create an inviting environment for all, as puregym say they do, and these rules are not enforced. multiple laminated sheets printed out telling people they will be banned for training semi- clothed and not putting their kit back = nothing actually happens.  *maintenance times. when kit breaks here it takes weeks/ months to fix. appreciate it’s a big company and bangor is out in the sticks so to speak, but this is still pretty shoddy. leg extender machine has had a nice laminated notice on it to not push beyond point 8 for 2 months, but not actually been fixed, shower door as above, cross trainer took 6 weeks + to fix…. when something breaks here there appears to be no sense of urgency from the on site staff particularly or puregym as a company. the urinal in the male changing room was full of urine for a month not long ago before it was fixed.  * water. the water as a whole here is an issue and they 100% have an on site issue , i’m a plumber and know what i’m looking for. the water fountain pressure is up and down and barely a dribble, shower pressure ,( when they work), is also barely a dribble and the male urinals flush 24/7, they never stop. this has nothing to do with saving water with regards to the low pressure, this is an on site issue. again going on for months, again not sorted.  the air con. the pace is stuffy and need good, reliable air circulation. it doesn’t have that, and as a consequence the place is warmer than a gym should be, and the plethora of gym members here who don’t smell every nice make the warm, sticky environment that little bit worse. the place has a smell to it which isn’t pleasant a lot of the time.   puregym really need to get their act together here, or all they’ll end up with having as members are the students who want a cheap gym membership, and mostly these are the same students who don’t put their weights back/throw their litter away/train half clothed - think on that one for a second.  they also need to employ a management team on site who is more proactive and gets stuff done. the gym and site has gone massively down hill over the last three months and continues to go more down the more time goes on, which will only get worse. the management team in place at the beginning of the year was more prone to challenging members and keeping on top of kit repairs, rather than laminating a sheet saying they’re doing it and then not actually getting it done. no offence to the current team as they’re lovely people, but they’re meek and reserved and don’t follow up on their promises to get issues sorted. ‘we’ve reported it’ and ‘we’re waiting for an engineer’ only holds so much water. report more, chase more, until it’s done. that’s customer service, that’s customer satisfaction and that is what this site is missing, which is a shame. the lack of experience from management here can be summarised by an instagram posts from the manager a few weeks ago. it was 20 odd degrees outside, so warm, and their water went off. no toilets/water fountain/showers or taps. but the manager put an instagram post up saying people can still come to the gym. you just can’t drink, pee or shower. the mind boggles.  a more customer focussed, business savvy manager, better enforcement of the rules and and more urgency regarding the repairs and that would sort this place, but at the moment it’s a mess.  que the pg copy and paste reply :)"," to be no accountability.

2,2023-07-05,Had to upgrade package just to breathe better in the gym,"i recently reactivated my membership with the off-peak package at pure gym enfield, enticed by its affordable price of £22. however, my experience has been far from satisfactory.  the main issue with the off-peak package is that it restricts users to access the gym only after 21:00. this limitation has resulted in overcrowding during the available hours, making it incredibly challenging to find any space, machines, or free weights to use. it defeats the purpose of a gym membership if you cannot utilise the facilities due to excessive demand.  pure gym enfield offers a solution to this problem by providing an upgrade option for an additional £7, allowing subscribers to access the facilities at any time. however, this feels like an unnecessary expense to overcome the gyms own overcrowding issue.  furthermore, i found the standards at the gym to be disappointing. the ventilation system appears to be inadequate, especially when the air conditioning is not in operation. poor ventilation poses a potential health and safety risk, particularly during intense workout sessions when fresh airflow is crucial.  overall, my experience at pure gym enfield has been unsatisfactory. the overcrowding issue during off-peak hours, coupled with the need to pay extra for a better workout experience, has left me disappointed. the subpar ventilation system further exacerbates the problems and raises concerns about the gyms commitment to its members well-being.  i hope that pure gym enfield takes these issues into consideration and makes the necessary improvements to provide a better experience for its members.","

(my asthma is well-regulated and i always check my sp02 before and after entering the gym.) my peak flow was fine but the stuffy air made me feel faint quite quickly.) i’ve spoken to the manager on various occasions about the inconsistency of the gym’s air quality and temperature, and he has told me that the air-con is set to a minimum of 20 degrees. this is warm for a gym and especially uncomfortable for high intensity cardio exercise. he told me that he can’t change the temperature. pure gym has stated on twitter that individual gym managers control their gym’s temperature and ventilation system; there is no company policy that dictates it. according to conor the manager, this is the temperature that keeps the bills down and most people don’t complain because they don’t do cardio. he can’t change it because he won’t change it, is his explanation in a nutshell. i’m a pt (and also exercise referral qualified) so am well aware of the impact on physical performance as temperature progresses. for people who want to run, row, cycle etc, it’s really uncomfortable and can cause faintness, with the potential for injury. i’m pretty close to cancelling my membership at this point, having tried unsuccessfully to deal with this directly.  update gym temperature 04/07/23: 22 degrees",". not much of an improvement.

1,2023-01-01,A Gym Best to Avoid,"i used a three day free trial at this gym to try it out as i wanted to join a gym. the first thing i noticed was that i could only go to the specific gym i had the pass for. i only noticed this once trying to gain access to the putney gym... but the code to enter didnt work. this wasnt a great start. the problem with these gyms being unstaffed is that you cant actually speak to anyone to resolve the issue and gain entry. you cant even phone them as they dont have a phone number. all you can do is email them and wait several hours for an answer, but why would you waste several hours waiting outside a gym for an answer to an email? very impractical  i then walked to the gym in wandsworth town which is the gym i had initially selected and fortunately gained access. i tried this gym out for three days and it also seemed like it was usually unstaffed. i at least managed to gain access and was able to exit the gym without much ado. although, needing a code to gain entrance and the gym being unstaffed didnt fill me with much confidence if the emergency services would need to gain immediate access due to needing a code to get in. if they did manage to get in by some quirk of fate, and needed to stretcher someone out then theres no way in a thousand years theyd be able to carry anyone out on a stretcher through those pods - even if they had a code.  i know they have their emergency leaver in case of an emergency, but they would still struggle to get in even if the emergency button worked properly.  from reading other reviews it seems like the emergency button has been used before and there was no help available.  for these reasons i would not recommend using this gym, even if it is somewhat cheaper than the competitors. the lower price comes at a higher risk!","

1,2023-05-13,Shocked,"visited first week this gym opened, quite shocked. former bodybuilder/frequent gym user. i read how in a week the gym annoyed some people by not having trainers present to be helpful with pin access to get through the doors. well i got through myself, but no worker in site in the middle of the day to show me around, like changing rooms etc. then half hour later they eventually appeared.  look, the gym has lots of space for such a small gym, lots of power racks, lots of benches. yes typically there’s many young people in groups stood around taking up space whilst on their phones doing nothing. but, plenty of space for everyone. but, disappointed the gym lacks for calves, hamstrings and seriously lacks for back.  anyway, my issue was i put my bag down right near me on second floor (as couldn’t access these mystical changing rooms cause no one was around) and minutes later i noticed my bag had gone. i reported this to a young blonde female worker who clearly wasn’t listening or respecting what i was saying as i repeated myself multiple times. i said to her that i think a cleaner took the bag. her response was we don’t have cleaners today. she then asked what was in your bag, i told her clothing, gym stuff, nothing valuable but i want it back. she then said she thinks the cleaner took it. erm, she just lied by telling me there’s no cleaner today now it’s the cleaners fault.. hmm then she proceeded to walk straight to the bin at the back and pulled my bag out (as if by magic) then walked off and said it’s because i left it on the locker bench. what right near me? out the way? that’s not the point anyway you don’t take other peoples stuff and if you do put it in a safe place don’t stick it in the bin! and don’t lie to me about the cleaner. lol.  then, as she disappeared, i turned around and noticed the my drinks bottle i’d put down on the same bench just to take my bag back off her had also gone. the blonde gym worker was the only person who walked past it!  now this is a bottle and some clothing. but that’s not my problem here! utterly out of order. not only did i repeat myself, have to insist the bag is found because she wasn’t going to do anything, have her lie to me, see my bag stuffed in a bin, have no professional apology, but she wasn’t attentive and didn’t take ownership for the fact it was actually her that did those things. if that was your belongings how would you feel? lol. wow.  i watched on as a few more people struggled to get through the door and the workers were slow to react. (which puts people off don’t ya know)  i’ll re review next time and expect a better approach and experience. and an apology! bet i don’t get one!"," on a proper apology, and now i’m being told i’m the one who left it!  i’m not a child,",

(im sure this shower temperature changes are not listed in the ""terms and conditions""). i joined the gym shortly after it was newly open but if there will be no changes to my ""no star"" reasons in near future, i will reconsider to join somewhere else where i feel comfortable, cold free and my money is well spent for. what is the point to get fitter when my health is jeopardised by catching a frequent cold from using no warm showers, being surrounded by dust mites or catching germs from an undisinfected equipment. well, what wont kill you, will make you stronger would not quite apply here.","

2,2023-04-25,Riverside <<< Castle Mall,"i have been going to castle mall’s puregym since early 2020. the gym there is absolutely fantastic, excellent atmosphere, high-quality equipment and people.  as a very happy customer i decided to add a secondary gym to my subscription as the one in riverside is now closer to where i work.  unfortunately to my surprise all the machines (cables-pulleys) are of a different brand than the ones in castle mall. older, of lesser quality and with heavier weights. now, this isn’t the end of the world and i know that different brands have distinct mechanisms/angles/calibrations making them feel different. however, when i subscribe to another puregym i expect the same level of equipment and quality, not a downgrade.  this probably happens in a lot of other puregyms across the uk, and some people might not mind it, but for me it really throws off my routine and makes it hard to focus on improvement. what’s the point of paying for a +1 access when i have to change my whole workout schedule/weights as the machines feel like they belong to a complete different gym chain.  i think it would be beneficial if puregym could provide a more consistent experience across all its locations. that way, i can rely on the same weights and machines, and i can focus on improving my shape instead of wasting time trying to adapt to different equipment.  i honestly feel torn to write this dissatisfying review as i will happily remain a pure gym customer, however i will not visit again nor recommend the one in riverside over the one in castle mall. especially to someone like me who wants to use both/switch.","

1,2023-04-16,Pure Gym puts members at Danger,"this evaluation arises from the observation that pure gym at bow wharf, and the company as a whole, prioritize profit over member safety. although i initially thought it was a good gym, on 16.04.23, a fellow member attacked me from behind without any provocation in the evening. fortunately, i was able to manage the situation, and nearby individuals performing islamic prayers heard my call for help and assisted in restraining the attacker. the police arrived shortly after and arrested the assailant, who was charged, but did not disclose his motives for the assault. i informed the gym of the incident, but they refused to cancel the attackers membership since it occurred outside the gyms front doors and because he is a member. i am concerned about the safety of other members since the gym has chosen not to inform them of the situation and is content to keep the attacker as a member, putting me in a difficult position. the following is my letter to them with legal obligations they need to fulfil which they are will to ignore.  dear pure gym bow wharf management,  re: pure gym puts members at danger - attacker mohammed baree  i am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding your handling of the matter where a pure gym member carried out a violent attack on me outside the gym premises, but on the canal & river trust grounds. the attacker, the attacker, was charged under the criminal justice act 1988 and now has a criminal record for his assault on me.  it is utterly disgusting that pure gym is retaining this violent criminal as a member, placing all other gym members at risk. this is not the first instance where a gym member has carried out a violent attack, and yet, the gym has taken no action to prevent such incidents from occurring. i refer to similar cases where gyms have failed to take appropriate action to protect their members, and such incidents have resulted in serious injuries and even fatalities. it is unacceptable that pure gym bow wharf is putting its members at risk by allowing violent criminals to retain their memberships.  in the united kingdom, gym members have a legal right to safety while using gym facilities. gym owners have a duty of care to ensure the safety of their members and take reasonable steps to prevent any foreseeable harm.  under the occupiers liability act 1957, gym owners have a duty of care to ensure that the premises are reasonably safe for all visitors, including gym members. failure to take reasonable steps to prevent harm or injury can result in legal action against the gym.  in cases where a gym member carries out a violent attack on another member, gym owners have a legal obligation to take appropriate action to protect their members. failure to take appropriate action can be seen as a breach of the duty of care owed to members and may result in legal action.  there have been several similar cases in the uk where gyms have failed to take appropriate action to protect their members from violent attacks. in one such case, a gym member was stabbed to death by another member in a fitness class. the gym was held liable for the death of the member as they had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the attack.  in another case, a gym member was attacked in the changing room by another member. the gym failed to take appropriate action, and the attacker was allowed to remain a member. the victim successfully sued the gym for failing to protect him from harm.  in cases where a gym member carries out a violent attack on another member, gym owners must take immediate action to ensure the safety of their members. this includes revoking the attackers membership and informing all members, tenants, and visitors of the incident and the steps being taken to ensure their safety.  in conclusion, gym owners have a legal obligation to ensure the safety of their members and take appropriate action to prevent any foreseeable harm. failure to take appropriate action can result in legal action against the gym and can have serious consequences for the safety of gym members.  furthermore, i will be taking this matter to the media as it is evident that the gym is more concerned with making money than ensuring the safety of its members. it is my hope that the media will highlight this issue, and the gym will be held accountable for its failure to take action to protect its members.  i urge you to take immediate action and revoke the attackers membership at the gym and all other pure gyms to ensure the safety of your members. i also request that you inform all members, tenants, and visitors of the incident and the steps being taken to ensure their safety.  *i am concerned about my friends and other gym goers and only by writing this review maybe pure gym will rethink about safety then profit.", owners are expected to maintain a safe environment for their members.  i urge you to cancel the membership of the attacker immediately and take all necessary,

2,2023-04-07,Very mixed bag,"been a member now for just over a year. the gym is kept very clean, staff are friendly, and the machines ok. however, like others here, i feel that the water temperature has been turned down too much recently. this is a false economy, as to keep the shower just above lukewarm, you have to keep the water flowing continuously. i guess all companies need to make savings at present, but puregym have gone too far with the water temperature - a few degrees warmer please!  update may 2023 puregym seem to have taken note of the complaints and responded by raising the temperature of the showers (a couple of weeks ago). not to previous levels, but to an acceptable shower temperature. they have also shortened the length of time the shower flows when the button is pushed from 30 seconds to 20 seconds, which is fair enough. i have therefore raised the star rating of this review.  update 05 june 2023:- puregym certainly know how to p*ss-off their membership! a new revamp of the website has now removed entirely your attendance record, the only thing i used to use it for! it is now just advertising and trying to get you to upgrade. back down to 3*"," stars, please.  i am now a 4* member.

1,2023-04-07,No Air Conditioning!!!,"main issue is the air conditioning. i have visited today at 6pm and air condition was not on and there was no staff around to ask to turn it on. this should not be something that needs to be asked to be turned on.  in the last 4 weeks the a/c had not been working for 3/4 days. i don’t know how they had kept it 4 days without a/c  also during ramadan, a lot of muslims visit the gym late night and again there is no air conditioning on.  due to this it’s hard to breathe firstly, especially with having asthma, it’s very stuffy and the equipment gets all sweaty which makes it really unhygienic. i’ve had to walk out everytime the a/c is not on as i struggle and i’m sure many others do.  i’ve sent an email which has not been responded to. i feel like because it’s a majority asian gym, they don’t seem to bother about these things.  fyi a/c can be scheduled on late at night, i have been to a gym out of oldham, late night 11.30pm and a/c was switched on.  machines are always broken and take way too long to fix. for example the smith machine, very popular and there is only two. one of the machines had been broken for just over 2 months. which meant i was either having to spend extra time waiting in gym or having to miss workouts!  next the water machine is broken and the sports drinks, which is paid for my members but then not available for a few days??  very very disappointed.","

1,2023-03-21,first time experiencing racism,i have been going gym over 6 years and never have i been spoken too so rudely by a gym manager in my life. she said i was slamming weights when i have not and been doing the same thing in many other puregyms and thegyms with no hassle. she’s making puregym look like planet fitness 🤦🏽‍♂️  i also witnessed other gym users doing worse but no response to them. i genuinely believe she was racially profiled me as a brown skinned muslim. i say this as she was looking at me funny since the moment i entered the gym. all i’m saying if your a brown skinned asian background you may get an unwanted lecture by daria uniatowska 🫤.  apart from her all the other staff were delightful and friendly 👌🏽. i been a member of puregym for years and won’t change just because of her. i been to many of their facilities from wales to england and all was such a good experience.  edit: i appreciate the quick response by puregym management. again i would like to illiterate puregym in general over the years was amazing and still is so today. it’s just one bad apple in stratford puregym who forced me to give one star as in my life i never experienced such a rude malicious behaviour. the gym itself however is beautiful and great equipment ✅👌🏽,".

1,2023-03-08,Terrible (even for a commercial gym),"this will be an interest read for anyone who has only seen pictures online etc and want a genuine understanding from someone who has been there multiple times. this gym lacks pretty much everything. the only strength i can give it is that it’s open 24 hours. firstly, it lacks machines which is fine if it were like most other puregyms and didn’t exceed 220+ people a day. it’s rather funny considering there’s about 3 stretching areas and massive, empty walkways for no apparent reason so there’s plenty of space to add machines. a lack of machines is one thing, but a lack of cable hooks is just embarrassing. honestly, you would laugh if you go there for the first time and realise there’s about 6 cable stacks/pull downs which are simultaneously without hooks, meaning the manager and co clearly didn’t pay enough attention to planning.  secondly, and more importantly, the clear lack of hygiene. someone else wrote a review concerning this and the response triggered me to also write one. trying to uphold a “sustainability” record is not an excuse for not providing cleaning equipment like every other gym does. it doesn’t matter how good you claim your cleaning regiment is, it won’t fix the fact that 20 different people have used the same bench before me and none had access to cleaning tools… i’ll talk about the sinks later.  thirdly, the staff, particularly the manager, lack respect. good luck trying to enjoy a peaceful workout with her around. constantly threatening the entire gym for someone to own up to placing a dumbbell in an incorrect area or what-not. with all due respect, it’s a commercial gym. no one really cares where the dumbbells are placed as long as they’re re-racked, particularly during busy hours. maybe you could get angry at things like this when you fix the basic problems of your gym first like the sink design. the priorities are completely mis-prioritised. i’d be far more concerned with how poorly your sinks are designed that your hand is literally touching the floor of the sink whilst you’re washing (which yes, is the definition of counter-productive as you’re literally re touching everything which has been washed off…)  really bad gym, certainly the worst puregym in the radius. however, if you’re a casual who turns up to a class once a week and doesn’t really interact with any weightlifting equipment, go ahead.","’re prepared to put in the effort to fix these issues, i’d say it’s worth a try.

1,2023-02-25,Unfinished and no excuses for such a poor state for a NEW Gym!,"clearly, puregym palmers was a rush job and opened not finished and is still stuck in that state...  how does this brand new spanking management head office approved gym fair months on?  -no wi-fi. there is zero signal inside so if you’re a parent that’s on call, or taking work break in the gym, or a local popping in you cant be called on an emergency. they did manage to get wifi for staff though, so there is no excuse not to chase for such a million-pound company with multi million network partnerships to send steve in to fix it asap. any internet service provider have an emergency sla to attend but their fails to be any chasing apart from i sent an email. i sent an email to my biceps but they didnt respond - work for it people!  mysteriously there is no engineer booking date and there isnt even an excuse for this. i have emailed the manager but she stopped responding. in the time puregym plamers green has been setup, i have setup 3 households with internet access to the same openreach provider as puregym and i dont have a high-power business account so whats the excuse puregym? this is fault of the higher powers at head office. this needs to be chased twice a day until there is a booking date but there is no responsibility. if there hasnt been chasing twice a day, fire the person who hasnt chased twice a day. if it has, fire the people who dont take responsibility to book. what an incompetency.  i managed to setup an internet connection. gladys did and shes an oap who has no idea what the internet even is, puregym is staffed and has how many departments? pull your finger out mate.  -some machines don’t have stickers to indicate how much weight you are lifting! after months? come on, put some tippex on the pulley machine. is there an excuse not printing your own stickers to show how much weight it being lifted? there is a print shop next door, literally! where is your budget of 50p to print some paper and get stickers for months? i tell you what, use the bio and the puregym advertisement leaflets to write numbers and stick them on the machine. if i were the manager i would do this and send it to head office demanding stickers next day.  -sweaty machines. ok, so the gym can’t force people to change their underwear or shower. if covid wasn’t enough, you can’t wipe the machines when an excrement-soiled person who hasn’t showered uses a machine, and you see sweat stains you have to touch and sit on and touch yuk!. trust me, in summer, where it’s worse, you will notice. already it smells due to the warm musky temperate - please dear lord above tell me the air con works but you can feel the bacteria and fungus growing due to no sanitary conditions whilst the inclusive radio announced once every 20 mins we at pure gym welcome use to use the cleaning stations and we are inclusive to everyone. well, there is a lie right there - management havent ordered cleaning stations and how can we count on inclusivity from the propaganda on the radio and the reality with our eyes?  -one wall is still chipboard and not painted. that’s how unfinished this gym is. its like working out inside those shed in b&q..oh! talking of b&q, there is one down the road. why not go and get some paint and do it up? you know what, that sickly colour makes my biceps shrivel away and shrink...leave it chipboard, at least i wont have to vomit onto my signals phone whilst the overly loud music and wretched heat makes me feel like im in a lucid nightmare.  -the music has risen considerably to an annoyingly loud level early in the morning playing the same one-dimensional genre. my wearable shows high noise levels if exposed. isnt this a health and safety issue? are people aware the same song repeats on loop again and again? its the most anti motivational trick but intended for 18 years olds. at least mornings until 4pm can you play somethign softer?  -the pec deck / rear fly machine handles are not an equal height. whoever assembled this wasnt much older than the pre-school who do amazing lego buildings across the road.. this isn’t just machine...this is both machines. is there a fix? i have an idea, hire that school kids to make it level. they will do a much better job that the team that left the gym unpainted, unconnected, no cleaning and setup the equipment that is failing and unequal.  -lastly, like other puregym, those signs of equipment out of order are starting to appear for weeeeks without any staff trained on how to tighten a machine. head office, let the gym staff do their job and give them a screwdriver or even a spare screw as its better than waiting 3 weeks for a repair company to travel from manchester to london to tighten a screw and have the machine out of order.", make sure every single one of my staff knew the weight lifting capacity of their machines. this is a scandal and i will report it to the relevant,

1,2023-01-30,Kids club,"i have been a member here for about 18 months and im afraid im seeing a slip in standards rather than a improvement and im looking for somewhere else to train. i fully understand you get what you pay for in life and certain times in the gym are busier than others and its a choice as to what time you go. but when your only window is around 430/5 this , unfortunately for me , seems to collide with school kick out times. the gym is swamped with kids/ teenagers id say between ages 14-17. all ""training"" in large groups, loitering around equipment , larking around , 5,6,7 of them at once. most not that interested in training , on their phones , chatting , not even in gym kit.  by the time the 6 of them have all had a little go , with the long group chats between sets , no exaggeration its 30/40 minutes before that equipment is available again.  the gym etiquette of these youngsters is none existent , to the point its almost funny. they all leave the gym without a drop of sweat on them . i dont overly have a problem with the kids , theres nothing else for them to do locally and if you dont know gym etiquette then how can you practice it.  my issue is the staff , gym managers and pts stood there seeing all this and doing/saying nothing. watching them leave equipment everywhere and just cleaning up after them. it screams of a place more interested in getting max numbers through the doors rather than a good training environment for all. im not suggesting kick them all out , we were all new in the gym once , but at least have a word as leaders in the gym to disperse the large groups and improve the etiquette. to summurise if your a new gym goer , can go weekday daytimes ,  or your a youngster looking for somewhere to hang out i would recommend this gym. but if you want any kind of intensive workout , your an immediate or advanced gym goer i really wouldnt recommend, it will just frustrate you and ruin it , your better off paying a bit more or travelling a bit further to get somewhere a bit more serious.","

1,2023-01-07,Bring back hip thrusts,"before the revamp, (sept/oct) you could find any number of girls and women at the back of the free weights doing barbell hip thrusts, all happy and content to set this up themselves. now following the revamp, there is no space to set them up but rather a thrust machine. i gave this machine a chance, but when i tried to stop my set i couldn’t get the weight and bar to lock which made me uncomfortable knowing i couldn’t stop a set whenever i began to struggle and wouldn’t be able to go to failure as i would have to lock the machine for a final raise. hip thrusts are a super simple exercise, so so basic and i don’t want to use a machine for them. simple as. i dont see the preacher curl stations being removed and forcing members to use the machine, the option is there. it’s so unfair to all of the paying members who want to set up, track the weight, and opt out safely of this exercise which often is performed with 80kg+ therefore the option to safely opt out is so important. i noticed another member move a box downstairs on the 6th of jan and set up the barbell and perform them the way she’s used to, then on the 7th i entered the gym and two big chest machines had been placed there, obviously to ensure there was no space for this practice to continue further. all i can say that is puregym is completely ignoring the wants and habits of its members. people are paying to go here and what you are offering as an alternative to thrusts simply isn’t good enough! you also say to go upstairs there’s a thrust area there- there’s a bench. with no barbell, no weights, just some weighted sacks, no one wants to use them. do you expect us to carry 6 plates and a barbell upstairs to use it instead?  i don’t know why this gym is being so adamant and stubborn about refusing to let people do thrusts which are a basic yet popular movement in a way that feels comfortable to them. why does it matter to you that much that you’d go out of your way to move equipment so people literally don’t have the space at all.  this is such a shame because i had noticed such an influx of girls doing them and i had hit so many pbs because the gym was so comfortable and well laid out but clearly you just see it as an inconvenience  additionally, the weights 1-10kg have been placed in the studio, i don’t think you realise this but this actually does isolate girls from feeling welcome in the gym, i just want to grab 7s to use with step ups on the box and now they’re in the studio which often has classes on.  all i can say is that i’m actually so disappointed you can see members habits and choose to completely isolate a group for the sake of what, either put some barbells and weights upstairs so girls can hip thrust, or keep boxes and some wall space free downstairs. there has to be a solution, we are the paying customers here and you’re making it feel like our workout is inconvenient.  i know i’m not the only one who feels this way as i’ve overheard the manager be asked what’s happened and he’s stupidly choosing to back up the layout decision. surely if people are bringing down boxes you can see that the layout is the problem, not the workout. i hope to see a solution very soon."," of them. now i don’t know where to go. puregym is failing miserably.

2,2023-01-05,Standards have dropped,les mills classes were never brought back after covid. i appreciate times are tough and they may be more expensive but they weren’t even replaced with an equivalent. now no studio classes on a saturday morning.  also less choice of evening spin classes as there used to be options of 6pm and 7pm classes but now just one. the bikes were replaced in the refurb just a few months ago but some are already out of order. nothing seems to be maintained or followed up as issues aren’t resolved from one week to the next.  not a fan of the new layout. the cardio machines are under such a low ceiling you can touch it - bizarre. most machines now face a wall so it’s just claustrophobic. the alternative is machines directly as you come in the door which i find intimidating as everyone is looking at you as they come in.,"

2,2023-01-03,This review is only about the lack of air conditioning,"this review is only about the air conditioning problems at the gym. the trainers, classes, equipment, etc. are all wonderful. but after waiting years for decent air conditioning and air circulation, and living through months of disruption due to the refurbishment - the problem with air still has not been addressed. the new functional room is totally without a/c. it is a most unpleasant place to train despite the wonderful new equipment and setup. the main gym floor is also very stuffy and tends to smell. when one enters the gym via the pods one is hit with stale, heavy air and a putrid smell. the studio and spin room are pretty good, admittedly! thank you for that at least! at this time of year there are many new members due to all of the new years resolutions to get in shape. as a gym regular i hear many complaining as the gym is advertised as having a/c but it does not feel like that once inside. i have spoken with the lovely manager and it seems as if he cannot control the a/c. please may i ask that you look at this seriously and consider the health implications of training in hot, still air. thank you very much.","

1,2022-12-20,puregrim,"when i joined the burnham puregym it was ok as a budget 24 hour gym but over the last year it has got worse and worse. they claim its a 24/7 365 gym as displayed at the entrance of my local gym but this in fact is a lie because they randomly close for reasons like the queens death, xmas eve, xmas day etc... they should not be making false claims to deceive people. also recently they have began to turn the carpark lights off at night resulting in higher crime such as car break ins and cars being stolen, due to the lack of light their cctv cameras are deemed useless so the chance of catching the criminals is almost zero. during the day the heating is too high and at night it is off meaning its almost impossible to train due to the extremities of temperature. they also shut the main toilets at night which means that if the only disabled toilet is blocked as it has been for the last 2 days you are stuffed. i complained about the shower in the disabled toilet either being stone cold or very hot last january and after being passed around a few times nothing has been done as the mixer valve is still not mixing. the way things are trending i would not recommend pure gym to anyone and if things are not improved i will be moving elswhere",".

2,2022-12-21,Following the recent renovations in…,following the recent renovations in puregym boucher road belfast i am confused and frustrated by some of the decisions made. the changing rooms have so few lockers now and everyone is crammed into one area while the rest of the changing room sits vacant. many of the patrons feel the same way. there is nowhere for anyone to move to and set their gym gear to get ready separately. no seats for people who need help or even just a feeling of space and support to get dressed away from others. the walk in cubicles provide privacy but that is all. surely after the pandemic this is not wise. the customer has not been considered properly here. the lockers are as small as ever. no efforts were made to make the changing room a better experience. rather the renovation has meant the changing rooms have suffered. additionally there is equipment placed on the gym floor in the most ridiculous areas so that people have to move sideways to get past or the user has to stop so that they can let people pass by safely eg bottom of steps. moreover after all this work the showers have remained the same… outdated and poorly lit. the bulb in the last shower is still not working properly as it has done for years. compare the showers in lisburn puregym and there is a big difference,". the customer feels they have been let down by the management here.

1,2022-12-17,Going down hill fast,"i have been debating writing a review for a while given that i loved this gym but similar to the other recent reviews that have been left, unfortunately the gym has gone down hill very fast and something needs to change. as someone else mentioned, cleaning now seems to be non-existent, all but 2 of the mens showers are out of order, the showers that are in order never seem to be cleaned, the changing rooms also seem very grubby (the floor needs a deep clean for sure) and there is clearly something wrong with the drainage system given the bad smell that comes from the sinks. its a real shame as the gym itself is still fine but its now noticeable how things arent monitored anymore.  i still love this gym and i think that with a few improvements as highlighted above, it could be back to what it was. something just needs to change otherwise i feel members will be looking to join a different one. for the first time i have started looking around at other options. come on puregym help us out.","

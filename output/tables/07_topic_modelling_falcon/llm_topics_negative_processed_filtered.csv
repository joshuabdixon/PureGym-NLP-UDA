1,2023-12-17,Absolute lack of respect with its customers!!!!!,almost a week with the gym shut and we still haven’t received a single email with an update on how to proceed. i can’t go to any other gyms like (finsbury park) being the nearest one - hence why i joined my local in seven sisters and not the other ones. i have to keep coming to check if the gym is re-opened every day because they have absolutely no commitment in keeping us in the loop. there’s no maintenance being carried out to try to solve the problem. it’s making me think that all this was a catch the £16.99 for the first 6 months offer - and they want us to cancel our membership which has now gone up to £24.99 a month.," i’m not sure if i’ll ever get my money back.

2,2023-12-17,Caution with PT's,"the gym itself i cant fault. very clean, to a good standard and well maintained.  however, take caution if you are considering hiring one of the pts there (i wont say who, due to it being there being an ongoing investigation regarding this pt).  the pt i hired promised, for £233 a month, 8 sessions and a fitness plan i could follow. however, this was not delivered. the in-person sessions completely contradicted the online sessions set, the diet plan was completely off from what i needed, the supplements didnt match to watch i stipulated (i told the pt i couldnt take creatine, yet the diet plan heavily relied on it) and i ended up with several injuries as a result of the exercises set-the reason i hired a pt was so i could recover from injuries, among other things.  the pt only delivered on 4 booked sessions, of the 8 promised. i met them for a 5th, however i wont count that one, he cancelled the booked one at short notice, and rearranged it for a time that was completely unsuitable. even though i attended, i only completed about half of it because i ended up with an injury, because he booked a running session the day after another running session, as the pt hadnt checked the online sessions he had set for me. i ended up not being able to rest my legs.  i didnt hear anything after that from the pt for over a week. i was surprised to find the pt had charged me for another month, with no direct debit set up, no subscription agreement set up, nor had the pt asked whether i wanted another month. the pt hadnt delivered on one months worth of sessions.  were now nearly 3 weeks since i had the money taken out, and the pt has still to book a session or even contact me. the clearly never intended on delivering a session this month.  ive tried contacting puregym, and making them aware of the situation. the pt is still operating at the gym, and the issue is still not resolved. i havent really heard from anyone, beyond the odd email to state they were aware. im not the sort to publicly shame, and i was prepared to give the gym time to resolve this issue. however, as i havent heard anything, i dont have much of a choice.","

1,2023-12-13,Not worth the price & lack of customer service,"i was so excited about puregym opening as it’s a 2 minute walk from my house and i can quickly go home and shower and go straight to work.  that was the only reason i joined as i was a member with the gym group and cannot fault their service.  the second reason i joined is they were having a promotional offer of £16.99 ( if you joined before they opened ) for the first six months and then the price increases to £32.99!  puregym need to rethink this price increase as members want value for money and they aren’t providing this.  for example: the constructed layout is small, and i expected a much bigger space for the price. there is too much wasted space and the deadlift rack could have been 6 instead of three and there are no mirrors by this area so you can’t see a side angle.  in addition the way the back extension has been positioned you can’t see a side angle as there is only one long mirror by the dumbbells and you don’t have a front view as it’s been placed in front of a pillar.  i discovered that the cable machines had the wrong stickers on each of the weights so if you thought you were choosing 2.3kg for example it was really 4.3kg. there should have been a sign informing members about this.  where the landline is positioned they have placed a carpet by the window / open doors so if it rains the water comes through and makes the carpet extremely wet.  i discovered this as i was using the landmine in a seated position and my tracksuit bottoms were soaked. i informed the manager and no sign was placed to inform other members.  whoever designed the gym left out critical elements. this gym is missing some key machines: biceps curl, triceps press, lat pulldown, lateral raise, calf press, hack squat and there is a very low amount of cardio machines for this price. for example there is only one upright bike.  there is a good amount of cable machines, but i couldn’t believe they don’t provide a cable straight bar which is the most used attachment for cable machines and a narrow grip landmine handle & row attachment. this is shocking. there is a good amount of functional stuff and that’s about it.  when puregym opened its doors to the public the first thing i was shocked about was the fact that the changing area, toilets/showers and lockers are all on the same floor and shared between men and women.  there aren’t enough lockers for members and they have also provided open shelves for people to put their possessions in which is ridiculous as there is a sign that says puregym can’t be held accountable for anything that goes missing. why didn’t they just provide more lockers?  my frustrations have increased as they opened on the 01/12/2023 and closed 13/12/2023 and didn’t send an email out to members telling us. i found out by going to the gym and seeing a sign saying the place has shut down due to a facilities issue and to use the closest gym to me.  this is a joke as the main reason i joined was the close proximity and the closest to me would be crouch hill, finsbury park or muswell hill which means an additional cost to pay for transport and the distance doesn’t work for me.  when i contacted customer service the only option i was given was to freeze my membership which i would have to pay £6.99 for each month.  i find this preposterous as no emails have been sent out to update members as to when the gym will open again. i could pay £6.99 to freeze my membership and they open tomorrow. we’ve been told to just keep an eye out for an email. this is shocking.  the gym group never do this. they give you a timeframe and keep you updated constantly. if i’m made to pay to freeze my membership i’m cancelling my membership. i feel a lot of members will leave after the first six months as the price increase doesn’t reflect the quality of this gym.", i went to return the membership card i was told that i had to pay £16.99 deposit which i had already paid.  the,99 deposit which i had already paid.  the

1,2023-10-23,Freezing cold changing room and shower,"the issue i am referring to pertains to the unreasonably cold temperature in the shower rooms designated for women. it appears that the air conditioning is continuously left on, resulting in an uncomfortable and unpleasant experience for gym members. the excessive coldness makes it challenging to have a refreshing and satisfactory shower, subsequently impacting our overall gym experience.  what concerns me the most is the dismissive attitude displayed by the staff when i have voiced my complaint. instead of actively addressing the issue, they have merely laughed and nodded in agreement, which is deeply disheartening. as a loyal and dedicated customer of pure gym, i believe that our concerns should be treated with utmost importance and professionalism.i kindly request that pure gym take immediate action to rectify this situation. it is essential that the air conditioning in the shower rooms is adjusted to ensure a comfortable environment for gym members. additionally, i urge pure gym to address the attitude of the staff towards customer complaints, emphasizing the importance of providing a supportive and respectful environment.","

(not in the ""ill help you"" way but in the ""how could you not understand this you idiot"" way) . at this point, im shaking and almost crying and he tells me that hes not actually on shift, just wearing the uniform?? i suddenly realise that my 2 seconds of a quick guide to not injuring myself was such a terrible waste of his time and ran to the other floor. xcite would never treat me like this. this was truly an awful experience.","

2,2023-08-22,Making changes to the gym without telling customers,i have been using this for over 3 years. i love that they have a studio because there is not enough room to workout in front of the mirrors on both floors. they have recently started a personal training program that is not a part of pure gym membership. i based my work schedule around the availability of the studio but recently they started the personal training which takes up the studio but it isnt posted on the app or the schedule on the board outside. the personal trainer kicked 7 of us out of the studio 10 minutes before the class was starting saying she needs to set up. there was no room near the mirrors on the first and second floor so i left and finished my workout at home. if it continues like this i will go to another gym that actually posts info about the studio in use. seems they are happy to treat the extra-paying customers better than the regular membership customers,".

1,2023-08-17,The dirtiest gym in Stratford,"i took out a membership this week at pure gym stratford and to say i was disgusted is an understatement. this past week i use the gym from around 4:30am till 6:30am and i can not believe the state of a 6 month old gym. firstly when entering you can see protien powder on the floor near the entrance which on the first day i assumed must be recent but the exact same patch was there on thursday 3 days later and hadnt looked like it was cleaned. multiple machines have out of order signs on them which is fine whilst the gym is empty but for multiple machines to be out of service for 4 days seems extremely uncaring. typical gyms or any public space tend to be their cleanest in the mornings as cleaning usually takes place at the end of shifts in most businesses but shockingly ive seen the same opened cans of redbud, spilled protein powder, electrolyte drink bottle and various other food wrapper and drink items left around the gym day after day. id like to assume that the staff are doing their best but to see the same rubbish for 4 days repeatedly is astounding. the weights have never been easy to find wether im looking for a specific dumbbell or plate which is inconvenient but i can blame users of the gym over the staff in this case but to see weights left in the same place between days seems strange considering this gym should be busy.  the biggest issue with this gym by far is the mens changing rooms. i can not explain the full extent of its filth. the horrible smell is actual putrid, the toilet cubicles have immense amounts of dirty toilet paper on the floor around them, there are stains on the floor and benches and what looks like hair and snot in the showers. i can not understand how there is not daily cleaning with a business of this kind. and there no sanitary stations like in other gyms. its a shame as the pure gym in stratford seems to be affordable considering the rapid growth of the local area but this gym either needs to increase its price to starve the less respecting customers and allow the rest to value the gym more as well as providing cleaning equipment so members can clean after themselves. and there needs to be some sort of cleaning schedule as i can not comprehend why its in such a state. i honestly would rather have a refund of the month and joining fee because this is genuinely shocking. i very much expect a bs corporate response but action needs to be taken immediately."," i feel this gym is not fit for purpose.

1,2023-08-16,Corner cutting & attitude,"started a class at wembley pure gym, bit chaotic initially as the trainer was late, i’m a 60 year old male with arthritis & scoliosis but still fit. i had previously done around 15 years of martial arts (30 years ago) both structured & unstructured but no matter where you train, in a boxing gym or a shack in thailand you always warm up & stretch else you can damage yourself. my arthritis in my shoulders is from the years of martial arts, my shattered right ankle still turns purple after i failed to warm up properly & wrecked it on a heavy bag. i assumed there was no warm up or stretch during the first class as the trainer was late & we were short of time but was oddly insistent on “hard & fast” on the punch & kick pads. i’d warmed up a bit anyway as i was early for the class but it was worrying to see absolute beginners attempting to kick a pad with their shin in full roundhouse & bashing away with their fists on the pads with no initial stretching. no time was spent on warm up or technique & if you are going to attempt any martial arts structured or not technique is what you learn before anything else else you will damage yourself. the second class i was late, no trains to wembley at the moment & the bus got stuck but i thought i’m only 5mins late so went into the class. so after some initial pad work the trainer started giving me a hard time as i was not fast & hard enough on the kick pad, fair enough but given the class history of both not warming up before attempting this & my arthritis & scoliosis (i’d flagged this with him during my first class) i thought i was doing well not to injure myself further. the issue is the trainer was raising his voice to the point that he wanted everyone to hear & there was an obvious attempt to embarrass me & then he started saying by me not making an effort i was effecting the partner i was sharing the kick pad with, that’s fine i thought but i am also aware that if i go hard & fast i can with no warm up also damage myself as i know from history. seconds later there was another rant about my apparent lack of effort & then about my lateness & that the class starts at 6pm & when the door is shut or whatever you don’t come in but as i say i missed the induction last time as the trainer was around 10mins late so as he’s raising his voice & it becomes pretty obvious that’s he’s just attempting to embarrass again i wanted to remind him that last time i attended he was late but at the time i thought these things happen. i said yeah sorry i was late & i wasn’t aware of your rules but i wanted to say actually you are a hypocrite & you need to practise what you preach, you rolled late into the class last time & no point did you say sorry about that. at that point i thought it was just easier to leave the class & so i did. the one star review is for the class i attended which i felt frankly was a little dangerous with its corner cutting, the rest of the gym is fine, clean & well resourced with good classes","ess & how i should have known better.

2,2023-07-31,Poor customer service at the London Finchley Branch,"i go regularly to puregym london finchley and i enjoy the classes very much.  unfortunately i work during the day (9am-5pm) and i really struggle to go to my pilates class in the mornings (i am on calls).  today i decided to pop into the new managers office and ask if it was possible to have pilates classes in the afternoon or evening at any point in the future.  the manager seemed to be offended by the suggestion and she took it personally. i apologized if i caused any stress and i ended up giving up because there was no way to reason with her.  before i left her office i explained that to my regret, i might need to change to another gym that has pilates classes when i finish work. i tried to help her to understand that i am spending too much money in extra classes at other places i thought that this information would calm her down but it made it worse.  to my surprise, when i left her office, she slammed the door behind me. unbelievable! i am still in shock.  i have been a puregym customer for many years but already cancelled my membership because i prefer to go to a more customer friendly gym.","  i would advise anyone who is thinking of joining puregym london finchley to reconsider.

2,2023-07-21,So much promise with such little delivery.,"the kit here is not bad at all, albeit skewed towards weights rather than cardio. in busy periods the (lack of) cardio kit can prove an achilles heel and having to wait for it can be frustrating. a little more thought towards the layout could actually fit more cross trainers / bikes in so this is something that would improve the place. free weights area is good. plenty of selection and kit. people are mostly tidy and put their kit back back, but as per other gyms this isn’t always the case. there are however some fairly big issues, hence the two stars. all of which could be easily resolved but the on site staff/ puregym as a company seem reluctant to do.  * male changing rooms. these are consistently dirty, even after the cleaners have just cleaned (if you ever witness the cleaners doing their job you’ll see why - very poor). the showers are also a bone of contention, and with only three to begin with the fact that they are now down to one shower for an entire male changing room in a busy gym is unacceptable. one of the out of order showers has had a broken door for 7 weeks, again unacceptable. inside of the lockers is consistently dirty too and many lockers have the locks left on all week, again not enforced by the staff.  * the rules are not enforced. there are multiple printed out sheets telling you of them , (they love a laminated document and some blu tac here), but little enforcement. groups of young males training vocally, not putting their kit back and half clothed doesn’t create an inviting environment for all, as puregym say they do, and these rules are not enforced. multiple laminated sheets printed out telling people they will be banned for training semi- clothed and not putting their kit back = nothing actually happens.  *maintenance times. when kit breaks here it takes weeks/ months to fix. appreciate it’s a big company and bangor is out in the sticks so to speak, but this is still pretty shoddy. leg extender machine has had a nice laminated notice on it to not push beyond point 8 for 2 months, but not actually been fixed, shower door as above, cross trainer took 6 weeks + to fix…. when something breaks here there appears to be no sense of urgency from the on site staff particularly or puregym as a company. the urinal in the male changing room was full of urine for a month not long ago before it was fixed.  * water. the water as a whole here is an issue and they 100% have an on site issue , i’m a plumber and know what i’m looking for. the water fountain pressure is up and down and barely a dribble, shower pressure ,( when they work), is also barely a dribble and the male urinals flush 24/7, they never stop. this has nothing to do with saving water with regards to the low pressure, this is an on site issue. again going on for months, again not sorted.  the air con. the pace is stuffy and need good, reliable air circulation. it doesn’t have that, and as a consequence the place is warmer than a gym should be, and the plethora of gym members here who don’t smell every nice make the warm, sticky environment that little bit worse. the place has a smell to it which isn’t pleasant a lot of the time.   puregym really need to get their act together here, or all they’ll end up with having as members are the students who want a cheap gym membership, and mostly these are the same students who don’t put their weights back/throw their litter away/train half clothed - think on that one for a second.  they also need to employ a management team on site who is more proactive and gets stuff done. the gym and site has gone massively down hill over the last three months and continues to go more down the more time goes on, which will only get worse. the management team in place at the beginning of the year was more prone to challenging members and keeping on top of kit repairs, rather than laminating a sheet saying they’re doing it and then not actually getting it done. no offence to the current team as they’re lovely people, but they’re meek and reserved and don’t follow up on their promises to get issues sorted. ‘we’ve reported it’ and ‘we’re waiting for an engineer’ only holds so much water. report more, chase more, until it’s done. that’s customer service, that’s customer satisfaction and that is what this site is missing, which is a shame. the lack of experience from management here can be summarised by an instagram posts from the manager a few weeks ago. it was 20 odd degrees outside, so warm, and their water went off. no toilets/water fountain/showers or taps. but the manager put an instagram post up saying people can still come to the gym. you just can’t drink, pee or shower. the mind boggles.  a more customer focussed, business savvy manager, better enforcement of the rules and and more urgency regarding the repairs and that would sort this place, but at the moment it’s a mess.  que the pg copy and paste reply :)"," to be no accountability.

2,2023-07-05,Had to upgrade package just to breathe better in the gym,"i recently reactivated my membership with the off-peak package at pure gym enfield, enticed by its affordable price of £22. however, my experience has been far from satisfactory.  the main issue with the off-peak package is that it restricts users to access the gym only after 21:00. this limitation has resulted in overcrowding during the available hours, making it incredibly challenging to find any space, machines, or free weights to use. it defeats the purpose of a gym membership if you cannot utilise the facilities due to excessive demand.  pure gym enfield offers a solution to this problem by providing an upgrade option for an additional £7, allowing subscribers to access the facilities at any time. however, this feels like an unnecessary expense to overcome the gyms own overcrowding issue.  furthermore, i found the standards at the gym to be disappointing. the ventilation system appears to be inadequate, especially when the air conditioning is not in operation. poor ventilation poses a potential health and safety risk, particularly during intense workout sessions when fresh airflow is crucial.  overall, my experience at pure gym enfield has been unsatisfactory. the overcrowding issue during off-peak hours, coupled with the need to pay extra for a better workout experience, has left me disappointed. the subpar ventilation system further exacerbates the problems and raises concerns about the gyms commitment to its members well-being.  i hope that pure gym enfield takes these issues into consideration and makes the necessary improvements to provide a better experience for its members.","

(my asthma is well-regulated and i always check my sp02 before and after entering the gym.) my peak flow was fine but the stuffy air made me feel faint quite quickly.) i’ve spoken to the manager on various occasions about the inconsistency of the gym’s air quality and temperature, and he has told me that the air-con is set to a minimum of 20 degrees. this is warm for a gym and especially uncomfortable for high intensity cardio exercise. he told me that he can’t change the temperature. pure gym has stated on twitter that individual gym managers control their gym’s temperature and ventilation system; there is no company policy that dictates it. according to conor the manager, this is the temperature that keeps the bills down and most people don’t complain because they don’t do cardio. he can’t change it because he won’t change it, is his explanation in a nutshell. i’m a pt (and also exercise referral qualified) so am well aware of the impact on physical performance as temperature progresses. for people who want to run, row, cycle etc, it’s really uncomfortable and can cause faintness, with the potential for injury. i’m pretty close to cancelling my membership at this point, having tried unsuccessfully to deal with this directly.  update gym temperature 04/07/23: 22 degrees",". not much of an improvement.

2,2023-06-09,Would not recommend,"i just started this week. had zumba, bodyfit and dance so far. zumba was fine (ok types, i have done more active zumba at another gym in west hampstead). bodyfit was also ok but dance was just weird. first 15 mins we did 2 songs in good active dance movements and just as i was beginning to sweat and burn fat, the instructor started showing us some moves on the mat (like pilates or yoga) and she spent so much time trying to explain us the moves that my body completely cooled down. the rest of the 30 mins was just her showing us steps, we trying to learn and then doing it. but im sure i didnt burn a single calorie. it would be good to have a dance class which claims to burn over 250 cals do just that and not bother with teaching us some spiderman moves! also the smell of sweat is way too overpowering and general cleanliness is clearly lacking, but so many people have said the same thing in the reviews and if nothing has happened so far, maybe itll stay this way. my goal is to lose weight and gain some core strength so i will be continuing but not as happily as my experience with studio society at west hampstead.","

2,2023-06-06,Some major issues need to be addressed,"the gym is totally fine when not too busy (e.g. weekend afternoons or late mornings), but due to its proximity to schools/college, its often flooded with groups of teenagers who dont respect basic rules like putting the weights back or cleaning equipment after their use. the lack of hygiene of these young gym goers is something that should be addressed by the staff as well. also, they tend to be glued to certain machines without actually doing anything (they are just chatting, laughing and playing games on their phones). the worst issue however is that many of them are underage (some look 11-12) which is against the gyms own rules (please see membership t&cs) and they clearly shouldnt be in this space. the workers dont seem to be bothered with this issue, but this is a serious safeguarding problem and may also invalidate the business insurance in case any injury is caused to (or by) these kids. i hope this feedback is taken seriously and some real actions will be taken to observe the gyms own rules by its workers and prevent underage kids from joining/attending the gym.","

1,2023-04-20,Bacteria infested swamp.,"about 2 months ago, i arrived at the gym to find that the women’s toilets were all out of order which is a monthly occurrence here due to all the mentally impaired people who work out here - clogging it with their sanitary towels among other things. it was no surprise.  i went up to management, needing to go to the bathroom. they informed me that they would accompany me to the male toilets to which i replied “i’d rather not as those will be filthy”. she reassured me that they had been cleaned “thoroughly” by staff, ready for women to use. i followed her to the male toilets, waited by the cubicles (both were in use). someone came out,..walked past her and me without washing their hands. once again not surprising, simply disgusting. i went to the bathroom, came out after touching the door handle which has probably never ever been cleaned since this place opened and headed to the sink. pressed on the soap machine, and there was no soap. despite the manager confirming that it has all be sorted etc. i turn to her and say “there’s no soap” she then turns to a locker to see if there’s soap stored there. there is not. i’m standing there in shock and mind boggled - thinking “when was the last time they even filled this up”. i would also like to mention this was at 5pm during rush hour. supplies should be doubled for that time. it was evident that she lied. the toilets were not clean, there was no soap and every single man who went into that bathroom could not wash their hands so they were just spreading their toilet infested hands all over the gym equipment. in addition to this, the antibacterial pumps are far and few between. 9/10 are empty whether that be at the entrance or down in the weights area.  i headed back to the women’s lockers to find out that people had forced their way into 2 out of the 3 toilets and tried flushing and flooded the whole bathroom. sewage just floating around. what a great start. bacteria not only on my hands but also in the air. what an absolute disgrace.  i’m not sure what is worse but having the manager lie to your face about the “thorough” clean that was done is honestly pathetic.  if there is another pandemic,..i’m sure it’ll spread nice and quickly here.  bring your own wipes, gel and soap cos they sure won’t have it here."," you want a clean gym, avoid this place. 9/10 are terrible.

Needs an update, lacking in comparison to other gyms in the area.","been going to this gym over 18 months and sadly, its going downhill. i dont know if theres a suggestion box, but know a few (especially female) members are feeling the same recently.  the weights area needs an update, especially in comparison to other puregyms and gyms in the area. theres two squat racks, one powerlifting platform, and two smith machines but understandably theyre very popular. theres only four 6ft barbells but they belong to the two squat racks, one powerlifting platform, and one bench press, so you feel bad stealing them. plates are hard to find and usually all over the place. the smith machines are ancient, they don’t even go all the way to the ground.  theres no hip thrust machine like other gyms or any space if you want to hip thrust or deadlift away from a squat rack. youd literally just be in the middle of the space and in the way. even if they invested in a hip thrust bench and barbell pad it would be better than nothing.  womens section has nothing in it but cardio and abductor machines. if the two spaces by the mirrors and two benches are taken, loads of women just have to workout in the middle of the room because theres a big ab mat holder in the only other decent space.  it has the potential to be an amazing gym but needs to be looked after a bit better, definitely falling behind. lately, there has been 50+ people in there from 7-10am, so gets quite busy which is great for peoples wellness but difficult for space. would be great if staff could consider updating equipment/layout.","

1,2023-03-08,Terrible (even for a commercial gym),"this will be an interest read for anyone who has only seen pictures online etc and want a genuine understanding from someone who has been there multiple times. this gym lacks pretty much everything. the only strength i can give it is that it’s open 24 hours. firstly, it lacks machines which is fine if it were like most other puregyms and didn’t exceed 220+ people a day. it’s rather funny considering there’s about 3 stretching areas and massive, empty walkways for no apparent reason so there’s plenty of space to add machines. a lack of machines is one thing, but a lack of cable hooks is just embarrassing. honestly, you would laugh if you go there for the first time and realise there’s about 6 cable stacks/pull downs which are simultaneously without hooks, meaning the manager and co clearly didn’t pay enough attention to planning.  secondly, and more importantly, the clear lack of hygiene. someone else wrote a review concerning this and the response triggered me to also write one. trying to uphold a “sustainability” record is not an excuse for not providing cleaning equipment like every other gym does. it doesn’t matter how good you claim your cleaning regiment is, it won’t fix the fact that 20 different people have used the same bench before me and none had access to cleaning tools… i’ll talk about the sinks later.  thirdly, the staff, particularly the manager, lack respect. good luck trying to enjoy a peaceful workout with her around. constantly threatening the entire gym for someone to own up to placing a dumbbell in an incorrect area or what-not. with all due respect, it’s a commercial gym. no one really cares where the dumbbells are placed as long as they’re re-racked, particularly during busy hours. maybe you could get angry at things like this when you fix the basic problems of your gym first like the sink design. the priorities are completely mis-prioritised. i’d be far more concerned with how poorly your sinks are designed that your hand is literally touching the floor of the sink whilst you’re washing (which yes, is the definition of counter-productive as you’re literally re touching everything which has been washed off…)  really bad gym, certainly the worst puregym in the radius. however, if you’re a casual who turns up to a class once a week and doesn’t really interact with any weightlifting equipment, go ahead.","’re prepared to put in the effort to fix these issues, i’d say it’s worth a try.

2,2023-02-09,Terrible,"terrible. this gym doesnt compete to fire house fitness: its pointlessly spacious, the bathrooms stinks of faeces, some of the machines had a yellow mold, the weight floor had a pointlessly long half wall for no reason. there was only 6 different pieces of equipment for the weight area, most being cable machines, the shoulder machine is uncomfortable. the instructions on the shoulder machine are on the hinge that stands the chair up. the cable machines top hinge is way to short. now the cardio experience isnt as bad, but i did only use 1 machine because of the lack of quality in the weight area. the cardio bikes are just uncomfortable. they are just way too small and with a little weight it feels as if it will just fall flat on its side.  the weight machines had a weird amount of resistance, sometimes the machine would just slide up with little strength needed. even on higher weights that i shouldnt be capable of using, over time the resistance just felt weird, when using the rope for the triceps most of the resistance was putting the weight back instead of pulling it out.  i dont understand the hype, im guessing the reviews are from people that have never went to another gym, so they have no comparison, but even a home gym could do 1 better as at least you can keep it hygienic enough to not have a built-up cheese mold on a machine.  overhyped. if you want to take exercise seriously, go anywhere else.","

1,2023-01-30,Disappointed by timing change - Beeston PureGym,"me and my friends were members of this gym, but now we have cancelled our membership because of these recent time changes. the least they could have done was kept the gym open till midnight. we used to always go in the evening, and it wasnt empty, in fact, we would hardly be able to use the equipment because it was so busy.  very disappointed by this pure gym. if the timings are changed back, we would come back to using this gym, as it is in a wonderful location. such a shame about the timing change.","

1,2023-01-30,Kids club,"i have been a member here for about 18 months and im afraid im seeing a slip in standards rather than a improvement and im looking for somewhere else to train. i fully understand you get what you pay for in life and certain times in the gym are busier than others and its a choice as to what time you go. but when your only window is around 430/5 this , unfortunately for me , seems to collide with school kick out times. the gym is swamped with kids/ teenagers id say between ages 14-17. all ""training"" in large groups, loitering around equipment , larking around , 5,6,7 of them at once. most not that interested in training , on their phones , chatting , not even in gym kit.  by the time the 6 of them have all had a little go , with the long group chats between sets , no exaggeration its 30/40 minutes before that equipment is available again.  the gym etiquette of these youngsters is none existent , to the point its almost funny. they all leave the gym without a drop of sweat on them . i dont overly have a problem with the kids , theres nothing else for them to do locally and if you dont know gym etiquette then how can you practice it.  my issue is the staff , gym managers and pts stood there seeing all this and doing/saying nothing. watching them leave equipment everywhere and just cleaning up after them. it screams of a place more interested in getting max numbers through the doors rather than a good training environment for all. im not suggesting kick them all out , we were all new in the gym once , but at least have a word as leaders in the gym to disperse the large groups and improve the etiquette. to summurise if your a new gym goer , can go weekday daytimes ,  or your a youngster looking for somewhere to hang out i would recommend this gym. but if you want any kind of intensive workout , your an immediate or advanced gym goer i really wouldnt recommend, it will just frustrate you and ruin it , your better off paying a bit more or travelling a bit further to get somewhere a bit more serious.","

1,2023-01-23,This gym is a disgrace,"this gym is appalling. there are lights that have not been fixed for months. the hot water was missing for weeks. the hours have been cut which means i cannot now train on a saturday morning as it does not open until 8am and if it does not change (a manager said it was an experiment for a few weeks), i will leave for a gym that is open from 7am. there are about four or five managers in here who do not want to take responsibility for anything and pass the buck to another manager. the trainers seem demoralised by them when you talk to them. not just the problems i listed above, but there are people training that block lots of machines at the same time. if you ask the trainers they say that have spoken to the managers but they do nothing. the gym is meant to be for everyone, not everything in the gym for the select few. taking two of a squat rack, bench press and treadmill should not be allowed, but having all three and dumbbells at the same time stops others training. what is needed in here is one manager that the buck stops with. that manager can get things fixed and stop anyone who uses more than one thing at a time. they could walk round putting weights away while stopping people doing that",". it is a shame that this gym has not been fixed and is now a mess. i will not be returning.

1,2023-01-07,Bring back hip thrusts,"before the revamp, (sept/oct) you could find any number of girls and women at the back of the free weights doing barbell hip thrusts, all happy and content to set this up themselves. now following the revamp, there is no space to set them up but rather a thrust machine. i gave this machine a chance, but when i tried to stop my set i couldn’t get the weight and bar to lock which made me uncomfortable knowing i couldn’t stop a set whenever i began to struggle and wouldn’t be able to go to failure as i would have to lock the machine for a final raise. hip thrusts are a super simple exercise, so so basic and i don’t want to use a machine for them. simple as. i dont see the preacher curl stations being removed and forcing members to use the machine, the option is there. it’s so unfair to all of the paying members who want to set up, track the weight, and opt out safely of this exercise which often is performed with 80kg+ therefore the option to safely opt out is so important. i noticed another member move a box downstairs on the 6th of jan and set up the barbell and perform them the way she’s used to, then on the 7th i entered the gym and two big chest machines had been placed there, obviously to ensure there was no space for this practice to continue further. all i can say that is puregym is completely ignoring the wants and habits of its members. people are paying to go here and what you are offering as an alternative to thrusts simply isn’t good enough! you also say to go upstairs there’s a thrust area there- there’s a bench. with no barbell, no weights, just some weighted sacks, no one wants to use them. do you expect us to carry 6 plates and a barbell upstairs to use it instead?  i don’t know why this gym is being so adamant and stubborn about refusing to let people do thrusts which are a basic yet popular movement in a way that feels comfortable to them. why does it matter to you that much that you’d go out of your way to move equipment so people literally don’t have the space at all.  this is such a shame because i had noticed such an influx of girls doing them and i had hit so many pbs because the gym was so comfortable and well laid out but clearly you just see it as an inconvenience  additionally, the weights 1-10kg have been placed in the studio, i don’t think you realise this but this actually does isolate girls from feeling welcome in the gym, i just want to grab 7s to use with step ups on the box and now they’re in the studio which often has classes on.  all i can say is that i’m actually so disappointed you can see members habits and choose to completely isolate a group for the sake of what, either put some barbells and weights upstairs so girls can hip thrust, or keep boxes and some wall space free downstairs. there has to be a solution, we are the paying customers here and you’re making it feel like our workout is inconvenient.  i know i’m not the only one who feels this way as i’ve overheard the manager be asked what’s happened and he’s stupidly choosing to back up the layout decision. surely if people are bringing down boxes you can see that the layout is the problem, not the workout. i hope to see a solution very soon."," of them. now i don’t know where to go. puregym is failing miserably.

1,2022-12-17,The gym is literally a building site,"the gym is literally a building site, with builders walking in and out when we are doing a class. the classes are vastly limited and there has been no spin for 6 weeks. it is as supposed to start back on monday 19th, but all the spin classes that i had booked for next week have been cancelled, so now i have no idea when spin will return. i understand that the gym is getting a revamp and will be great once it’s finished, but feel like we shouldn’t be getting charged full membership fees for limited services.","

1,2022-12-17,Going down hill fast,"i have been debating writing a review for a while given that i loved this gym but similar to the other recent reviews that have been left, unfortunately the gym has gone down hill very fast and something needs to change. as someone else mentioned, cleaning now seems to be non-existent, all but 2 of the mens showers are out of order, the showers that are in order never seem to be cleaned, the changing rooms also seem very grubby (the floor needs a deep clean for sure) and there is clearly something wrong with the drainage system given the bad smell that comes from the sinks. its a real shame as the gym itself is still fine but its now noticeable how things arent monitored anymore.  i still love this gym and i think that with a few improvements as highlighted above, it could be back to what it was. something just needs to change otherwise i feel members will be looking to join a different one. for the first time i have started looking around at other options. come on puregym help us out.","
